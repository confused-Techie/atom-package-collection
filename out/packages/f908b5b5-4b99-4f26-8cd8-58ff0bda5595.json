    "readme": "# fsync-on-save\n\nWhen Atom saves a file, sometimes you need to flush all the\ndata to the storage device immediately. For instance, you might want to\nmake sure data is written to a persistent storage medium promptly, or\na file might be on on a removable drive that may be unplugged without\nnotice.\n\nThis simple package does an `fsync()` or equivalent to write all the\ndata immediately.  The `node.js` function `fs.fsyncSync()` is called\nafter the file is written.\n\nThe original motivation for this package was to make Atom be a safe\neditor for use with [Adafruit Industries CircuitPython](https://www.adafruit.com/circuitpython).\nCircuitPython will automatically reload and restart when a file is\nwritten to the `CIRCUITPY` drive. Several operating systems do not\nwrite all data and metadata to USB drives immediately. This\ndelayed-write behavior can cause auto-reload to read an incompletely\nwritten version of the updated file (such as `main.py` or `code.py`)\nwhen CircuitPython restarts. It can also cause the `CIRCUITPY`\nfilesystem to become corrupted if the board is unplugged or reset\nbefore the file is completely written.\n\nAs of this writing, this delayed-write behavior is noticeable on\nWindows and Linux, but not on MacOS. Note that Linux may still write\nadditional metata to `CIRCUITPY` a minute or so later after saving the\nfile, causing an auto-reload. That's a different problem which this\npackage cannot address.\n",
