    "readme": "# html-includes package\n\nThis package allows you to write partial html documents and combine them together on save. This way, you don't have to write server-side logic or worry about performance with html include statements.\n\n# usage\n\nAdd the html tag\n\n`<partial src=\"exampleIncludeFile.html\"/>`\n\nto your html document to include an outside file. Then, rename your html document with the extension .anomalous. Now, every time your .anomalous file is saved, a .html file will be generated where your partials will be included in the resulting html file.\n",
