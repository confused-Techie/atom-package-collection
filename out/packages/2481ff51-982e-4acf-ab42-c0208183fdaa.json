Props to derek on the discussion site for the\n[original solution](http://discuss.atom.io/t/scroll-performance-behavior/291/21).\n\nNote that currently open tabs are unaffected when enabling or disabling the\npackage. It's a fun way to compare the scroll speed!\n\n## Installing\n\nUse the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or\nrun `apm install woah-there-mousewheel` from the command line.\n",
