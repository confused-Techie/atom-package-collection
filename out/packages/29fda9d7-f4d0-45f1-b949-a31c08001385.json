    "readme": "# create-webpack-split-point\n\nWebpack 2 exposes import() a async module loader that will automatically define a split point and create a new bundle in your code that will only be loaded if the system.import is executed. React components that are not part of initial paint are a taylor made use case for this. This module aims to abstract a way the work of creating one of these components.\n\n<img src=\"./create-split-point.gif\" />\n\n## use\n\n`apm install  create-webpack-split-point`\n\nIn atom right click inside of a component you wish to turn into async bundled split point and select Create Webpack Split Point. This wil create two files, index.js which exports the async component and component-async which writes the comopnent that loads the split bundle in componentDidMount.\n\nFor example if you exexcuted in /components/header/header.js. Then in the place you want to use the async header component you could simply import from the directory.\n\n```js\nimport Header from \"./components/header\";\n```\n\nAs soon as componentDidMount in Header is fired `import` will be called and it will asynchronously load the bundle containing the Header component and render it on the page, before that a Component returning null will be rendered.\n\n- - -\n\nCopyright (C) 2017 Social Tables, Inc.
