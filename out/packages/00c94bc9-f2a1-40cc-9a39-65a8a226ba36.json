    "readme": "# Reveal In Finder\n\nThis is a little hack that I did so I could map a key binding to reveal\nthe current file in finder. Its pretty minimal and it wouldn't be hard to\ngeneralize if only there was a software developer around.\n\nMap it like:\n\n```\n'atom-text-editor':\n  'alt-cmd-r': 'reveal-in-finder:reveal'\n```\n\nThen hit that puppy to reveal the current file's parent directory in a\nFinder window.\n\nI have not done any form of thorough testing, I only know it works on my\nmachine (Mac OS running High Sierra). The whole thing relies on running a\nchild process for `open '<DIRECTORY>'` so if that command does not work in\nyour terminal then _this package is not for you_.\n\n## Install\n\nIt's on the marketplace, so the regular channels should work.\n\n\n\nIf not, see the\nhack below.\n\n\n### Hack Install\n\nI did this before I published to the marketplace.\n\n```sh\ncd ~/.atom/packages\ngit clone https://github.com/nolanbconaway/atom-reveal-in-finder.git\ncd atom-reveal-in-finder\napm install\napm link .\n```\n",
