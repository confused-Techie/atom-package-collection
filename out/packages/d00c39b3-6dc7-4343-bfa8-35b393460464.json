    "readme": "# Shiny UI Theme\n\nUpdated for Atom 1.0!\n\nShiny UI is a bright, fresh theme. All elements are slightly flattened, lightened, embiggened and Helvetica-ized.\n\n![Shiny UI](http://adrianlogue.github.io/images/shiny-ui-v0.32.0.png \"Shiny UI\")\n\nI recommend matching Shiny UI with the Fizzy Syntax theme by Joel Glovier (https://atom.io/themes/fizzy)\n\nThis theme can be activated by going to the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`)\nand selecting it from the _UI Themes_ drop-down menu.\n\n\n## Horizontal scrolling in Tree-View\n\nIn the initial releases of Shiny UI, I set it up so that the Tree View pane automatically resized to fit it's contents and thus eliminated ever having horizontal scrolling in the Tree View. This was very much a personal preference which I recognise isn't for everyone, and it had the downside of making the Tree View pretty massive if you had a particularly long filename or deeply nested folders. So I've disabled it by merging a pull request generously supplied by Mateus Dalto Piveta (https://github.com/mdalpi).\n\nIf (like me) you prefer the old auto-resizing and lack of horizontal scrolling in the Tree View then you can re-enable it by putting the following into your styles.less:\n\n```less\n.tree-view-resizer {\n    width: auto !important;\n\n    .tree-view-resize-handle {\n        cursor: default;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis should work in most UI Themes by the way.\n\nFurthermore to re-instate the rounded corners and padding around the selected items in the Tree View, add this to your styles.less:\n\n```less\n@import \"ui-variables\";\n\n.tree-view,\n.tree-view:focus {\n    .selected:before {\n        display: block !important;\n        left: 6px;\n        right: 8px;\n        border-radius: @component-border-radius;\n    }\n}\n```\n",
