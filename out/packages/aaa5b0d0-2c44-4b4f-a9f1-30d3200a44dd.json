    "readme": "# Laravel Facades\n\nAn atom.io package to view the source of built-in Laravel 4 facades.\n\n## Installation\n\nUse the atom package manager, which can be found in the Preferences view, or run `apm install laravel-facades` from the command line.\n\nThis package assumes your composer vendor/ directory is at the root of the project you have open as that it what it uses to retrieve the source files to open.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis package can be accessed view the `Packages/Laravel Facades` menu in the top menu bar, or it can be accessed by opening the command panel using `cmd + shift + p` and typing the Facade class name and hitting enter when the correct item is selected. If there are other items in the command panel, just prefix what you're searching with `Laravel Facades` or `Facade` to narrow the results.\n\nWhen a Facade is selected using either of these methods, its source file will open in a new tab.\n",
