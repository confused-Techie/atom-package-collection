    "readme": "# Fold-whatever\n\nFold-whatever is a package for the [Atom code editor](https://atom.io/). It allows the user to specify ranges to be folded with the help of regular expressions. The default values are are the regexes suitable to fold [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) inlined footnotes and references.\n\nFold-whatever is my first atom package. I am grateful for any comments and suggestions.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\napm install fold-whatever\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThe regular expressions can be set in the settings page of the package.\n\nFold everything between the brackets in one line. fold everything away:\n\n`/\\<.+?\\>/g`\n\nKeep the brackets visible by using 3 matching groups. This regex will fold the range from the end of the first group to the beginning of the last group:\n\n`/(\\<)(.+?)(\\>)/g`\n\nMatch over multiple lines. Line-breaking spaces have to be matched:\n\n`/(\\<)(.|\\s)+?(\\>)/g`\n\n## Changelog\n\n### 0.2.5 -\n* add toggle/[un]fold all 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th regex\n\n### 0.2.4 -\n* add toggle\n* fixed cursor jump, stays now at its position\n* tested if multi-line regexes are possible. Which is the case, but they are only matched by toggle/[un]fold-all.\n\n### 0.2.2 -\n* fixed scope of (un)fold-here to include \"bracketing\" regex regions\n\n### 0.2.1 - First Release\n* [un]fold-here : [un]folds at curser when a regex matches\n* [un]fold-line : [un]folds all matches in a line\n* [un]fold-all : [un]folds all matches in a file\n",
