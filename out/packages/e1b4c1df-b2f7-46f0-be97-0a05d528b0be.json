    "readme": "# ghdl-interface package\n\nThis package uses command line tool ghdl and gtkwave software (both are free)\nto compile and run VHDL codes directly from atom.\nYou'll need to install both softwares to get the best out of the plugin.\n\nPressing f8 runs a compilation of the current file.\nPressing f9 runs a compilation of the current file, the last testbench used,\nand then runs the code, opening the resulting signals on gtkWave.\nPressing f10 opens a dialog that lets you select a new testbench for the\ncurrent file or run the code with the last one.\n\nIf there's not a previous selected testbench, it automatically assumes that\nyour testbench is named as the main code's file, with a _tb after the name\n\nExample:\n  Main file:  ANDgate.vhd\n  TB file:    ANDgate_tb.vhd\n\nWarning! Code will run successfuly if you use the run commands by having main\npane window as active pane.\n",
