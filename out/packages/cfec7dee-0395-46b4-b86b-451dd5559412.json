I really love the Solarized syntax theme just like [@aclissold].\n\nThis is a very simple fork of his [Lunarized] syntax theme. He did a wonderful job of darkening Solarized. However, I wanted to keep more of the blue that I believe sets Solarized apart from other syntax themes. This simply adds a darker, less saturated version of `base02` and `base03` to Lunarized.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n### To get the Atom package:\n\n* Bring up Settings via `cmd-,`\n* Go to the Themes page\n* Search for Lunarized-Solo and install\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n[![Atom Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/11yfWizh.png)](http://i.imgur.com/11yfWiz.png)\n\n[Solarized]: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized\n[Lunarized]: https://github.com/aclissold/lunarized-syntax\n[@aclissold]: https://github.com/aclissold\n",
