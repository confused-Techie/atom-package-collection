    "readme": "# code-location : a package for `atom` editor\n\n*code-location* is a tool that lets you know where you are in your code, by showing you your location (class, function, etc.) \nin the status bar of the Atom editor.\n*code-location* works by analyizing the indentation of the edited file.\nUse a code beautifier to make sure your indentation is correct. If the indentation is wrong, *code-location* might not work well.\n\n# Example\n\nEditor:\n\n![Editor Screenshot](images/Function_screenshot.png)\n\nStatus-bar:\n\n![Statusbar Screenshot](images/StatusBarLocation-big.png)\n\nAs seen in this example, the current cursor is inside a `class`, then within a function called `getResult()`, therein \ninside an `if`, and lastly inside a `while` loop.\n\n# Features\n- You can more easily understand where you are in your code. So there is less chance you get confused about your location in complicated code.\n- You can see how much your current line is indented (indentation count).\n\n# How to install\n\n- Via the atom package manager (`apm`):\n  - `apm install code-location`\n- Or inside the `atom` editor, on the Settings page (Control-,), on the install tab.\n- Or from `atom.io` website\n  - https://atom.io/packages/code-location\n\n\n# Package for `atom`\n\n![Atom logo](https://dl2.macupdate.com/images/icons256/53196.png?d=1518722998)\n",
