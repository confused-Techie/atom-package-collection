    "readme": "# cursory-glance README\n\nAtom package that highlights the cursors when there are more than of them. (Using VSCode? See the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tuomassalo.cursory-glance).)\n\n## Features\n\nI found myself forgetting the multi-cursor feature on, and editing multiple places by accident. So I wrote this package that annotates the cursor with the number of cursors. The extension is activated when the user creates multiple selections with e.g. `cmd-d`.\n\n![GIF](./atom.gif)\n\n## Extension Settings\n\nNo settings for now.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- If there are more than nine cursors, only `*` is shown in the badge. That's just laziness.\n\n## Release Notes\n\n### 0.1.0\n\nInitial release.\n",
