    "readme": "# seeing-is-believing package\n\nIntegrates Atom with [Seeing Is Believing](https://github.com/JoshCheek/seeing_is_believing),\nallowing Ruby programs to show you the result of each line of code that was evaluated.\n\nHere is an example session:\n\n![example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/josh.cheek/images/scratch/sib-example1.gif)\n\n[Here](https://vimeo.com/73866851) is a longer video that goes into more details.\n\n## Using the package\n\nKeybindings:\n\n* `Command+Option+B` to annotate every line\n* `Command+Option+N` to annotate just marked lines (mark them by placing `# =>` after them, or below them)\n* `Command+Option+V` to remove annotations\n\nSnippets (use SiB to play around with ideas without needing a complex environment):\n\n* `s_arb` in-memory ActiveRecord::Base code, so you can play with models without Rails.\n* `s_sinatra` Example Sinatra app with Rack-style invocation setup for you to play with.\n* `s_nokogiri` Parse html, play with css selectors, etc.\n* `s_reflection` Examples of useful reflection tools.\n\n\n## Install the Atom package\n\n* Atom -> Preferences -> Packages\n* Search for \"seeing is believing\"\n* Click \"install\"\n\nOr, you can do it from the command line `$ apm install seeing-is-believing`\n\n\n## You need [Seeing Is Believing](https://github.com/JoshCheek/seeing_is_believing) installed\n\nThis integrates into your specific environment, it doesn't come with the gem loaded by default.\nInstall it by getting into the environment you want, and running:\n\n```sh\n$ gem install seeing_is_believing\n$ seeing_is_believing -e '1 + 1'   # to check that it worked\n```\n\nIf you use rbenv, you may need to `$ rbenv rehash`\n\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Custom / non-working Ruby environment\n\nAtom loads your environment by launching a new shell and copying its environment\nvariables into Atom's environment variables. So, assuming that your shell sets\nyour Ruby, then everything should just work. Note that [it looks](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/9ab6a07df3c9f271d9d4fb5ff2a9b257e3bc8fb7/src/update-process-env.js#L79)\nin the `SHELL` environment variable to decide what shell to use\n(you can change yours with `chsh`).\n\nIf `seeing_is_believing` is not available by default in a new shell (perhaps\nbecause it's not located in a `$PATH` directory, or your Ruby environment needs\nsome fancier setup) then you can use the \"Seeing is believing command\"\nconfiguration option to either change the name or pass an absolute path to a\nscript you wrote. This allows you total control over how to set it up.\nI've used this to setup non-standard environments and then exec SiB.\nWhen I want to try features from my development SiB, I set mine to `/Users/josh/code/seeing_is_believing/bin/seeing_is_believing`.\n\n\n### Flags\n\nYou can get a full list of flags by running `seeing_is_believing --help`\nThe most common and useful ones are going to be:\n\n* \"--alignment-strategy\" (defaults to \"chunk\", but you may want \"file\")\n* \"--number-of-captures\" (say you have a line that executes in a loop, 1 million times,\n  you don't want to record all 1 million of those invocations, because it's too much information,\n  it would eat up your memory, maybe start paging, and just generally take a really long time to execute)\n* '--line-length' (how much output to show, use this to keep it from affecting editor performance or getting too spammy)\n* '--timeout' (say you accidentally have an infinite loop... don't want to wait around forever!)\n\n\n## <a href=\"http://www.wtfpl.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.wtfpl.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wtfpl.svg\" height=\"20\" alt=\"WTFPL\" /></a> License\n\n    Copyright (C) 2014 Josh Cheek <josh.cheek@gmail.com>\n\n    This program is free software.
