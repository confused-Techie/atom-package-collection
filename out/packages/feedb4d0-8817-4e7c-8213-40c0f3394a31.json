    "readme": "# Protoboard :rocket:\n\nA code prototyping tool for human productivity.\n\n## What is this?\n\nAn extended prototyping clipboard for [Atom](https://atom.io).\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThere are only two commands: __Copy__ and __Swap__.\n\n__Copy__ text in the current editor to storage using `shift-ctrl-C`. Continue\nworking, making changes. Realize you want to go back to the way things were.\n__Swap__ the current text in the editor with the text in storage using\n`shift-ctrl-X`. Make some more changes. Realize that you were right all along,\nand __swap__ the new changes with your old changes.\n\n## Why?\n\nHave you ever wanted to just try some code out, and not have to worry about\ngetting back to the point where you know everything was working?\n\nUse Protoboard to avoid:\n\n* Repeatedly pressing `ctrl-Z` and `shift-ctrl-Z` to test new code.\n* Making an unnecessary Git commit and using `git-revert`.\n* Copying a section of code, commenting it out, and working on the copy.\n* Copying an entire file's contents to a new file and working on the original (yikes!).\n\n## How do I install it?\n\nUse the Atom Package Manager, or install it through the CLI using:\n\n```shell\napm install protoboard\n```\n\n## Extended Features\n\n* __Copy all__ text in open editors to storage using `shift-ctrl-A` followed by `shift-ctrl-C`.\n* __Swap all__ text in open editors with the text in storage using `shift-ctrl-A` followed by `shift-ctrl-X`.\n\n## Coming Soon :construction:\n\n* Numbered snapshots.\n* Snapshots of specific lines.\n* Revert to last git commit state (while keeping current state in storage).\n",
