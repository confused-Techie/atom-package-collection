    "readme": "# Hyrule [for Github Atom]\n\nHyrule from SublimeText ported to Atom.\n\nA pair dynamic greens along with a soothing orange, and an addictive yellow make up the main palette of Hyrule. Well-chosen background and primary text colors leave a developer's eyes fit for another day of study. Works very well in `Java`, `Go`, `JavaScript`, and `HTML`.\n\nSome colors have been remaped to be more similar to the 2014 version of Hyrule as I remember it. Hyrule was so good that I immediately adopted it for the Java and Handlebars work I was doing at the time.\n\n### Installing from Github\n\nYou can install Hyrule from Github easily for development use!\n\n1. Clone this repo:\n\n    ```\n    $ git clone git@github.com:AuthorOfTheSurf/hyrule-atom.git\n    ```\n\n2. Hop into the directory\n\n    ```\n    $ cd hyrule-atom/\n    ```\n\n3. Run `apm link` to add the package to your Atom install's packages directory. This is how you install local/cloned packages/themes in general.\n\n    ```\n    $ apm link\n    ~/.atom/packages/hyrule-atom -> ~/Development/themes/hyrule-atom\n    ```\n\n4. Open up Atom in dev mode just to be sure that it reads `~/.atom/packages`. Should work without this.\n\n    ```\n    $ cd your_project\n    $ atom -d .\n    ```\n\n5. Press `cmd + ,` to open up the settings menu. Click \"Themes\", then find Hyrule in \"Syntax Theme\". All done!\n",
