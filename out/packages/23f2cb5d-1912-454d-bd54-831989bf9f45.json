    "readme": "# atom-tree-view-dblclick package for the Atom editor\n\nBy default, the atom tree-view for browsing files/directories will open a file or collapse/expand a directory listing just by single-clicking on the entry.\n\nThis package changes this by forcing the user to double-click on a files. Directories can be opened by double-clicking the directory name or single-clicking the little arrow next to the directory name, as is the default behavior in most editors.\n\n## Install\n\n```\napm install dbclick-tree-view\n```\n\n## Credit where credit is due\nThis package is heavily inspired by the [atom-double-click-tree-view](https://github.com/hszhsh/atom-double-click-tree-view)\nand [atom-double-click-tree-view](https://github.com/mattsfrey/atom-double-click-tree-view)\npackages. So a huge shout out to them.\n",
