    "readme": "# bg-ui-font-sizer package\n\n#### 2020-09 Update\nThis project uses the bg-atom-utils npm package which now installs a number of extensions to the atom.* API objects. I think that they are\nunlikely to cause problems, but if you experience any, please take the time to create an issue on this package to let me know. I am very interested in addressing any issues quickly.\n\n#### Summary\n\nChange the size of fonts in Atom UI.\n\nThis package adds commands that dynamically change font size of the bundled Tree-view and the Pane Item Tab controls that appear on each of the WorkspaceCenter, LeftDock, RightDock, and BottomDock areas. The effect of changing these font sizes is to zoom in and out.\n\nThis is particularly useful for the tree-view where you can zoom in or out to see your project tree at different levels. I find this works well in conjunction with the bg-pane-navigation package so that I can navigate around the workspace with the keyboard and zoom in/out of where ever I am at with the keyboard.\n\nNote that some themes, such as the dark themes bundled with Atom have a configuration to set the UI font size. If you just want to\nincrease the readability on a high resolution monitor those themes offer a good solution. Aside from addressing that issue on themes\nthat do not offer configurable font size like the light themes bundled with Atom, this package is useful to be able to adjust the tab\nsizes of the 4 different places where PaneItem tabs appear independently. I generally make the WorkspaceCenter tabs bigger and the\nDock tabs smaller.\n\nIf you find yourself with so many editor tabs open that there is not enough of the names visible to tell them apart, you can temporarily make the tab font for the WorkspaceCenter very small to seem more of the names. With your focus in an editor window execute the bg-tabs:decrease-font-size' command (`ctrl-_` by default -- note that `_` is shift minus).\n\nI have only tested this on my linux workstation using the bundled Atom themes. Create an issue if you have problems in your environment because I would like it to work well in all environments.\n\n#### Commands\n\nThere are two sets of commands -- those for the tree-view and those for tabs. For each, you can increase/decrease the font size and\nalso increase/decrease the line height. You can also reset the font and line height to its original styling. The tab commands also\nhave a modal dialog that can be opened to enter a mode to adjust the tabs. This was necessary because its not practical to find non-conflicting\nkeystrokes for all the tabs in any context you could adjust them in.\n\n| Command                            | KeyMap                       | Description\n|---                                 |---                           |---\n|'bg-ui-font-sizer:run-tutorial'     |                              | Start the tutorial for this package again\n|---                                 |---                           |---\n|'bg-tree-view:decrease-font-size'   | .tree-view: 'ctrl--':        | zoom tree-view out\n|'bg-tree-view:increase-font-size'   | .tree-view: 'ctrl-=':        | zoom tree-view in\n|'bg-tree-view:decrease-line-height' | .tree-view: 'ctrl-up':       | squeeze tree-view vertically\n|'bg-tree-view:increase-line-height' | .tree-view: 'ctrl-down':     | stretch tree-view vertically\n|'bg-tree-view:reset-font-size'      | .tree-view: 'ctrl-0':        | remove styling so that theme default applies to tree-view fonts\n|---                                 |---                           |---\n|'bg-tabs:decrease-font-size'        | `ctrl-_`                     | zoom out tabs of focused dock/center\n|'bg-tabs:increase-font-size'        | `ctrl-+`                     | zoom in tabs of focused dock/center\n|'bg-tabs:increase-line-height'      |                              | stretch focused tabs vertically\n|'bg-tabs:decrease-line-height'      |                              | squeeze focused tabs vertically\n|'bg-tabs:reset-font-size'           | `ctrl-)`                     | remove styling so that theme default applies\n|'bg-tabs:toggle-size-dialog'        | `ctrl-alt-_`<br>`ctrl-alt-+` | opens a model dialog to adjust all the tab sizes.\n|'bg-tabs:size-dialog-next'          |                              | in modal dialog, cycle through tab locations\n|'bg-tabs:size-dialog-previous'      |                              | in modal dialog, cycle through tab locations\n\nNote that the 'bg-tabs:...' commands are context sensitive. They apply to the Dock or WorkspaceCenter that currently has the user's\nfocus. If the bg-tabs:size-dialog is open, they apply to the location that is currently highlighted in the dialog. When all locations\nare highlighted (cycle to that with the tab key), the commands act on all the tab locations at once.\n\nThe 'bg-tree-view:...' commands are not context sensitive but the default keymaps for those commands are only active when the focus is in the tree-view.\n\nNote that I registered the commands from this package under the 'bg-tree-view:' and 'bg-tabs' prefixes because I wanted you to\nfind them in the command palette when searching for those things for which they apply to. I included the bg- prefix so that you can\ntell that they are not native to the tree-view and tabs package. The downside is that they are not as strongly associated with this\npackage but hopefully the bg- prefix is enough to lead back here if needed.\n\n#### Keymaps\n\nIn general, my packages provide only keymap suggestions that you need to put in your keymap.cson because I believe that it does more\nharm than good to assume the keystrokes you should use.  This package does provide a keymap, though, for two reasons. First, it\nprovides keymaps for its modal size-dialog which can not conflict with anything else. The whole purpose of that modal dialog is to avoid\nkeymap conflicts my providing a mode that the user enters while adjusting tab sizes. Second, the other keymaps it provides seem pretty\nsafe. There is a config setting to selectively disable the keymaps that are not associated with the modal dialog.\n\nHere is the .atom/pacakges/bg-ui-font-sizer/keymaps/bg-ui-font-sizer.cson file copied reference.\n\n    # by adding shift and alt to the keystrokes that typically zoom in/out, we open the modal dialog\n    # note that these are shift keystrokes because _ and + are shift characters on their keys\n    '.platform-linux atom-workspace':\n      'ctrl-alt-_':   'bg-tabs:toggle-size-dialog'\n      'ctrl-alt-+':   'bg-tabs:toggle-size-dialog'\n\n    # once the modal dialog is open, we can control the keyboard without risk keystroke conflict. (so these are aways safe)\n    \".bg-ui-font-sizer-dialog\":\n      'ctrl-+':     'bg-tabs:increase-font-size'\n      'ctrl-=':     'bg-tabs:increase-font-size'\n      'ctrl-_':     'bg-tabs:decrease-font-size'\n      'ctrl--':     'bg-tabs:decrease-font-size'\n      'ctrl-down':  'bg-tabs:increase-line-height'\n      'ctrl-up':    'bg-tabs:decrease-line-height'\n      'ctrl-0':     'bg-tabs:reset-font-size'\n      'ctrl-)':     'bg-tabs:reset-font-size'\n      'escape':     'bg-tabs:toggle-size-dialog'\n      'tab':        'bg-tabs:size-dialog-next'\n      'shift-tab':  'bg-tabs:size-dialog-previous'\n\n    # add context sensitive zoom to tree-view. By default, Atom will zoom the text editor with ctrl-+/- even when the focus is\n    # in the tree view. This seems like a safe change because I think that it makes it more intuitive to zoom the thing where your\n    # focus is.  ctrl-up/down are also mapped for to vertically squeeze and expand the tree items (line height adjustment).\n    # LMK by creating an issue if this caused problems for you. I'd like to know.\n    '.platform-linux .tree-view':\n      'ctrl-0':     'bg-tree-view:reset-font-size'\n      'ctrl--':     'bg-tree-view:decrease-font-size'\n      'ctrl-=':     'bg-tree-view:increase-font-size'\n      'ctrl-up':    'bg-tree-view:decrease-line-height'\n      'ctrl-down':  'bg-tree-view:increase-line-height'\n\n#### How it works\n\nThe main thing that the commands do is sets the font-size css property on a container node of the thing being zoomed in or out.\n\n\tthis.treeViewEl = document.querySelector('.tree-view.tool-panel');\n\tthis.treeViewEl.style.fontSize = '18px'\n\nBut there are two problems with this. Atom's themes css include a very specific rule that hardcodes .list-items line-height to 25px\nand the selection highlight bar (implemented as ::before content) height to 25px.\n\nThis package uses the bg-atom-utils NPM node_module's BGStylesheet class to dynamically add more specific styles that override those\nrules from the theme.\n\nYou could probably figure out static rules that make those properties relative to font-size but I decided to use dynamic rules so that\nI could also dynamically change the font-size to line-height proportions.\n\nThe default atom-light-ui theme (at least on my workstation) makes the tree-view list items very small with a lot of space inbetween\nthem.  (11px font and 25px line-height = 230%).  I personally find that odd,  but think more people would find this package useful if\nit allowed keeping that 230% line height if desired. Thats really why I incuded the line height adjustment but now that its done, I\nfind that I use it all the time to squeeze a whole folder into view when needed.\n\nThe reset command removes all the dynamic styling so that the Atom theme defaults apply again. After doing a reset (or before issuing\none of the other package commands), this package will be dormant and not mess with your styles at all.  \n\n#### Hacking Tip\n\nIf you want to play around with this package in ways that are not exposed through the commands, open devtools console (window:toggle-dev-tools) and explore the bg... global variable. Start typing the `bg...` to see what mechanisms are available to explore.\n\n  * bg.BGAtomPlugins.logStatus() : list the packages that use the BGPlugin style\n  * bg.BGAtomPlugins.get(pkgName) : get a reference to a package plugin instance to explore\n  * bg.PolyfillObjectMixin.logStatus() : list the Atom polyfills that are installed (these add features to Atom API)\n\nWhen you complete a command that returns an object, it will be logged in the console where you can expand it to explore its current state. You can autocomplete further to navigate to the sub-objects and if you assign an object to a variable in the console, you can invoke its methods and see what they do.\n```javascript\n> pkg = bg.BGAtomPlugin.get('<packageName>')\n> pkg.addCommand(...)\n```\n",
