    "readme": "# Atom Fellowship\n\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/dimanech/atom-fellowship/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/dimanech/atom-fellowship)\n\n> ‘I will take the Ring,’ he said, ‘though I do not know the way.’ J.R.R Tolkien\n\n![Fellowship screencast](https://raw.github.com/dimanech/atom-fellowship/master/fellowship-screencast.gif)\n\nAtom plugin for operating with group of related files as single file (open, switch, close, create). You can open files in split view and easily navigate around all fellows.\n\n## Features\n\n* Open related files in split view\n* Synchronous tab switch\n* Synchronous tab close\n* Config for switch and close only with first file\n* Option for vertical side-by-side split view\n* Option to create files if they do not exist\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing `apm`:\n\n```\napm install atom-fellowship\n```\n\nOr search for `atom-fellowship` in Atom settings view.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThis plugin useless without configuration.\n\nFor configuring fellows you need to provide array with 3 (or more. See below) values:\n\n1. **String with Regex**. Used to much needed file.\n2. **String for replace**. Used to replace path in files. As usual this is folders names.\n3. **String for replace**. Most cases this is some namespace. As usual this is file extension or namespace.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Match extension only\n\nConfiguration for simple header-source project structure\n\n```\n./inc/file.h\n./src/file.c\n```\n\nwill be like this:\n\n```\n.*inc.*.h, .h\n.*src.*.c, .c\n```\n\n#### Match directory and extension\n\nConfiguration for simple MVC project structure\n\n```\n./project/controllers/file.js\n./project/views/file.xml\n./project/styles/file.css\n```\n\nwill be like this:\n\n```\n.*controllers.*.js, /controllers/, .js\n.*views.*.xml, /views/, .xml\n.*styles.*.css, /styles/, .css\n```\n\n#### Match not equal directories and namespace\n\n```\n./lib/controllers/ns-file.js\n./prj/controllers/_file.js\n./prj/views/_file.js\n```\n\nConfiguration:\n\n```\n.*lib\\/controllers/.*.js, lib/controllers/, _ns-\n.*prj\\/controllers/.*.js, prj/controllers/, _\n.*prj\\/views.*.js, prj/views/, _\n```\n\n#### Match not equal directories namespace and different file types\n\n```\n./lib/controllers/foo-file.js\n./prj/controllers/bar-file.js\n./prj/styles/baz-file.css\n```\n\nConfiguration:\n\n```\n.*lib\\/controllers/.*.js, lib/controllers/, foo-, .js\n.*prj\\/controllers/.*.js, prj/controllers/, bar-, .js\n.*prj\\/styles.*.css, prj/styles/, baz-, .css\n``` \n\nCheck your config by opening `Application: Open your config` for any cases.\n\n#### More than 3 fellows\n\nIf you need you can add more than 3 fellows via your `config.cson`. But not more than 9 because this is limitation of Fellowship of the Ring!\n\n```cson\nfellow1: [\n\t\".*lib\\\\/controllers/.*.js\"\n\t\"lib/controllers/ns-\"\n\t\"foo-\"\n\t\".js\"\n]\nfellow2: [\n\t\".*prj\\\\/controllers/.*.js\"\n\t\"prj/controllers/\"\n\t\"bar-\"\n\t\".js\"\n]\nfellow3: [\n\t\".*prj\\\\/styles.*.css\"\n\t\"prj/styles/\"\n\t\"baz-\"\n\t\".css\"\n]\nfellow4: [\n\t\".*prj\\\\/views.*.xml\"\n\t\"prj/views/\"\n\t\"waldo-\"\n\t\".xml\"\n]\n```\n\nSeriously you could not comfortably work more with 4 splitted views.\n\n#### More than 3 replace\n\nYou can provide more than 3 replace strings (unlimited potentially), but probably *you don't need that*.\n\n### Windows machines\n\nPlease note that **Windows** FS paths should be like this:\n\nIn Atom config:\n\n```\n*some\\\\path*.scss\nsome\\replace\n```\n\nIn cson should be:\n\n```cson\n\".*some\\\\\\\\path.*.scss\"\n\"some\\\\replace\"\n\"_ns-\"\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis plugin cannot cover cases where:\n\n* obviously plugin can match only files with same part in the name\n* one fellow has namespace and other don't have one. Because `\"\"` cannot replace `\"ns-\"`. Plugin will work only on namespaced files, and you can use settings to somehow work with this\n\n## Getting started\n\n* Press `shift-alt-F` to load plugin and open all related files or `shift-alt-C` to create fellows\n* Close first pane file to close all related files\n* Switch first pane files to switch all fellows\n\n## Settings\n\n* `splitHoriz:false` side by side layout\n* `onlyFirstCloseOthers:true` only first fellow close others\n* `onlyFirstSwitchOthers:false` only first fellow switch others\n* `openEvenIfNotExist:false` create fellows if they not exist on open\n\n## Keyboard Shortcut\n\n`atom-fellowship:openFellows`, default `shift-alt-F`: load plugin and open all related files\n`atom-fellowship:createFellows`, default `shift-alt-C`: load plugin, open all related files and create if someone not exist\n\n## Help out\n\nAny help is welcome 🙏\n\n## License\n\nMIT © Dima Nechepurenko\n",
