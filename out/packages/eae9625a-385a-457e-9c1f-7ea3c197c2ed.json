    "readme": "A beautiful syntax theme that helps focus on the important and avoids being distracted by multitudes of styles and (signal) colors.\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Ruby Screenshot](ruby-screenshot.png)\n\n## Principles\n\n### Minimal highlighting, just 5 classes:\n\n1. Strings\n2. All statically known constants (numbers, keywords, boolean, etc)\n3. Global definitions\n4. Standard language keywords (def, if, else, etc)\n5. Comments\n\n### Comments highlighting\n\nComments are clearly visible - unlike in many other syntax themes! I think if there are comments we should see and read them first.\n\n### Readability / contrast\n\nFor good readability text has contrast 6:1 and it is consistent for all colors. Contrast calculated with [HCL color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_color_space). Secondary color contrast is 2.5:1\n\n## Supported languages\n\n- Clojure\n- CSS\n- Elixir\n- GitHub Markdown\n- HTML\n- JavaScript\n- Ruby\n- Perl\n- PHP\n- Python\n- XML\n- YAML\n\n## Install\n\nFrom the command line:\n\n`apm install handsome-light-syntax`\n\nIf the command line isn't your thing:\n\n- Go to **Settings > Install**\n- Search for `handsome-light-syntax` and click **Install**\n- Go to **Settings > Themes** and choose **Handsome Light** from the dropdown menu\n- Happy coding! :heart:\n\n### Thanks\n\nForked from the (inactive) [Chestnut Light Atom](https://github.com/biletskyy/chestnut-light-atom-syntax) syntax theme by [Dmitry Biletskyy](https://github.com/biletskyy).\n\nThanks also to [Ferdinand Vogler](https://github.com/fv0) for the excellent [native-ui UI theme](https://github.com/fv0/native-ui) that plays exceptionally well with this syntax theme.\n",
