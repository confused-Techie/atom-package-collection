    "readme": "# change-line-length\nAn [Atom](https://atom.io) text editor package that lets you cycle through\ndifferent user-defined Preferred Line Length settings\n\n## `change-line-length` in Action:\n\n![Action](./misc/change-line-length.gif)\n\n## History:\n\nBecause I frequently switch my Preferred Line Length between 80 characters (for\ndocumentation) and 100 characters (for code), I often spend too much time\nnavigating to the editor settings panel, scrolling down, and manually adjusting\nthis setting.  There exists some packages that allow you to insert multiple wrap\nguides, but I've found this solution to be somewhat of a distraction.  Also,\nmany packages, such as [`autoflow`](https://atom.io/packages/autoflow) and\n[`text-align`](https://atom.io/packages/text-align) are dependent upon the\nPreferred Line Length setting; having multiple wrap guides can be confusing when\nusing these packages as only one of the wrap guides will represent the true\nPreferred Line Length value being used.  So I decided it would be best to make a\npackage that allows the user to set as many Preferred Line Length settings as\nthey want and give them the option to cycle through them quickly, with key\ncommands.\n\n## Instructions:\n\nAtom doesn't seem to provide a way for the user to input values into an array in\nthe package settings in the same way one can input integers (correct me if I'm\nwrong!), so you must edit the `config.cson` to add your own custom preferred\nline length values.  Find the settings section for `change-line-length` in the\n`config.cson` file (Atom > Config...) and add your preferred values:\n\n    \"change-line-length\":\n      preferredLineLengthValues: [\n        80\n        100\n        120\n        ...\n      ]\n\nAfter you've saved you `config.cson` file, you'll need to restart Atom for the\nsettings to take effect (this is intentional as capturing the array values on\nthe fly during each run is inefficient).  You should be able to use the package\nto quickly change between your Preferred Line Length settings.\n\n## Note:\n\nThere seems to be \"bugginess\" associated with running this package if the\nsettings tab is open and set to the editor (the location of the Preferred Line\nLength setting).  So if you are experiencing any sort of strange flickering when\nrunning the package, try exiting out of the settings tab.  I can't seem to fix\nas this seems like a bug with Atom.  I've experienced many bugs when trying to\nset settings via the settings tab; these bugs include the setting not actually\nbeing recognized or settings \"flickering\" between an older and newer value when\ntrying to update a value.  These bugs existed for me long before creating this\npackage and I think they are the root cause for the strange flickering that\noccurs when this package is ran while the settings tab is open.  If anyone has\nany sort of ideas for a fix, please let me know, as stability is always a\npriority for me.\n\n## Thank You\nThanks to both @[Aerijo](https://github.com/Aerijo) and\n@[DamnedScholar](https://github.com/DamnedScholar) for helping me\n[here](https://discuss.atom.io/t/changing-an-atom-setting-through-code/57728)\nand\n[here](https://discuss.atom.io/t/bugginess-associated-with-changing-atom-settings-via-code/57772)\nwhen I ran into bugs putting this package together.\n",
