It is not supposed to replace any professional tool, instead, it is a support package to avoid installing many database tools.\n\n<img alt=\"Dbex - A Hackable Database Explorer For Atom Editor\" src=\"https://github.com/marcelkohl/dbex/blob/master/samples/main.png?raw=true\">\n\n## Resources\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border:0px;\">\n   <tbody>\n      <tr>\n         <td>\n         <b>Easy to manage</b>\n         <p>Multiple database connections can be managed through the Databases tab.

Everything that is related to the database is done by the engine as processing queries, controlling connection pools, retrieving structures and so on.\n\nEngines can be created by anyone just by following the [base template](https://github.com/marcelkohl/dbex-engine-base) and filling the mandatory methods. Dbex will communicate with the installed engines to make things happen.\n\nAs soon as other engines are available it will be listed here. For now this is what we have:\n\n|Engine|Description|\n|---|---|\n|[Base Engine](https://github.com/marcelkohl/dbex-engine-base)|Sample engine used as base structure. It does nothing, just an example|   \n|[MySQL](https://github.com/marcelkohl/atom-dbex-mysql)|Support to the basic aspects of MySQL resources, including v.5.x and v.8.x|\n|[MariaDB](https://github.com/marcelkohl/atom-dbex-mariadb)|Support to MariaDB resources|\n|[Cassandra](https://github.com/marcelkohl/atom-dbex-cassandra)|Cassandra support - BETA|\n\n## TODO\nWhile many resources where implemented there are still some small issues to fix and also other resources that would be nice to have and probably will be implemented soon:\n\n- Prevent \"paste query\" on query area to hide the result area. it is happening when result area is not visible yet;\n- Show actions on right click instead of node icons;\n- Edit result directly on table result (engine result must have a list of cols/references to send on confirm edit. ex.: mysql is the pk col name);\n- Show divider between query and result (where we can see easily where to drag to resize);\n- custom plugins for query area (ex.: action buttons, indentation);\n- Custom plugins for result area (ex.: exporter);\n- On edit connection, replace entry at same position instead of in the end;\n- Draggable connections to reorder in tree;\n- Auto complete on query area;\n- Identify query executed from textEditor and replace or create new result tab (uuid or title), not on a generic tab;\n- Add promise on dbex side to avoid engine blocking atom;\n\n## Warranty Disclaimer\nThe following disclaimer was written thinking in all professionals that works with data and know how important data is.\n\n**All work here is provided ​“AS IS” AND I CANNOT MAKE ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. As this is a side project from myself and a non-commercial product, I cannot give any warranties about the correct and full functional product.
