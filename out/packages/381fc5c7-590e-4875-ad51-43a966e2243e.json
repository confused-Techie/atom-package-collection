    "readme": "# Remove Keybindings Collisions package\n\nAllows you to remove those keybindings from other packages that collides with your own keystrokes.\n\n## Usage\nIt has two modes. If you check the 'Exact Keystrokes' checkbox it will only remove those keystrokes that have an exact match. If not it will remove also partial match. In this mode it will remove those keystrokes that share the same beginning for example if you have 'ctrk-k j' it will remove 'ctrl-k ctrk-l'.\n\nAlso, at least in Linux, this helps to improve the performance when defining a keybinding with a keystroke which beginning is in others keybindings.\n",
