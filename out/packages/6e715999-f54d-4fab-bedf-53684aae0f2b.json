    "readme": "# Waterpaper UI\n\nA digital replica of an early user interface design, from back in the olde times when UI was done in watercolor. Being quite aged now, it may be a bit tough to read. But it helps to see just how difficult UI work was in the olde days.\n\nNOTE: Waterpaper UI doesn't really work well with dark syntax themes. It Works fine with light and solarized themes. Reportedly, dark themes were the bane of ancient UI.\n\n## Amazing Inkscape Filters\nWaterpaper UI uses one of [Inkscape's](https://inkscape.org/) outstanding filters to yield a relatively realistic watercolor effect.\n\n> CSS with Solarized Light syntax theme.\n![CSS with Solarized Light](screenshots/waterpaper-ui-main.png)\n\n> Markdown preview with Atom One Light syntax theme. Makdown previews are a special sort of fun in watercolor.\n![Markdown with Atom One Light](screenshots/waterpaper-ui-markdown.png)\n\n> Find/replace in JSON with Base16 Tomorrow Light syntax theme.\n![JSON with Base16 Tomorrow Light](screenshots/waterpaper-ui-json-find.png)\n\n> Font used in screenshots is [Fira Code iScript](https://github.com/kencrocken/FiraCodeiScript/).\n\n## Credits\n\n* [@Atom One Light UI Team](https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui) - core UI design\n* [@Ugotsta](https://github.com/Ugotsta) - design concepts and ugly code\n* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) - SVG watercolor filter effect\n\n## Features\n\n* Shows how unfeasible it is to code using watercolor.\n* CPU-intensive styling accurately emulates sluggish interfaces of olden times.\n",
