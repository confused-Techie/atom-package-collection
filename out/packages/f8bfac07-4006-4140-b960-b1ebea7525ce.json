    "readme": "# HTML Special Characters Replacer\n\n*Replace special characters with HTML Symbol's decimal value.*\n\nThis package will convert special characters into HTML Symbols, using the decimal equivalent. I tried to get all the HTML4 & 5 characters included, but it's possible I missed some, or am converting one that probably shouldn't. Please contact me if there's one I did miss, or one you feel I shouldn't convert.\n\nThe goal of creating this was to make HTML that would display properly in any format, such as: as a web page or an email.\n\nIf text is highlighted, changes are only made to the selected text. Otherwise, the entire document is changed.\n\nPress F10 to run the function, or select from context or Packages menus. Am looking into having it run automatically when pasting into an HTML grammar document, similar to the functionality of TopStyle 5.\n\nModeled after [dumb-quoter](https://github.com/lukefg/dumb-quoter).\n\n#### Example\n![Example of package in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BRiL1201/html-special-character-replacer/master/screenshots/Screenshot.PNG)\n",
