    "readme": "# zencalmeque theme\n\nThis SYNTAX theme got it's start in Textmate and the Zenburnesque theme.  It's a \"calmed down\" variation of\nthat theme with number of different colors reduced as well as generally muting the intensity of\nthe original theme's color choices.  Some of the color choices in this theme trace\ntheir roots back to Borland Turbo Pascal and Delphi days, especially, the comments, reserved keywords,\nconstants, strings, etc.  Over the years (decades) as the color choices evolved from a mere 16 to 256 and more, I've adapted my color preferences and this theme is pretty much where I am with my\neditor colors for Atom, VIM, TextMate, etc.\n\n![Zencalmeque Screenshot](https://github.com/mwlang/zencalmeque/blob/master/theme-screenshot.png)\n\nNOTE:  The screenshot shown always utilizes the SETI-UI theme.\n",
