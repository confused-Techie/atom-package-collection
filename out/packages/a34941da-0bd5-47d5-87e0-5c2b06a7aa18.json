    "readme": "# tree-view-click\n\n## Description\n\nBy default, the atom tree-view for browsing files/directories will open a file or collapse / expand a directory listing just by single-clicking on the entry.\n\nThis package allows user to choose single / double click on a file to open it, or on a directory to expand/collapse it. This effectively turns a single-click into just selecting the item clicked on, which is the default behavior in most editors.\n\nWhat's more, this package allow user to custom the mode of open file: pending pane or permanent pane.\n\n## Settings\n\n- `Allow Pending`: 'If this option and `Allow Pending Pane Items`(in core setting) are both set to true, single click will open a file in `pending pane`, otherwise open in a `permanent pane`.'\n- `Open File`: Single click or double click.\n- `Open Folder`: Single click or double click.\n\n## P.S.\n\nThis package is a copy from [dbclick-tree-view](https://atom.io/packages/dbclick-tree-view), I added some enhancement to it, but I can not contact with the author to merge the pr in github. So I forked it and publish here.\n\n## Change log\n\n### 0.1.0\n- init\n\n### 0.1.1\n- update readme\n\n### 1.0.0\n- add `Allow Pending` option.\n- update setting names\n- better logic to handle single click and double click\n\nThe reason adding `Allow Pending` option is that if turn off `Allow Pending Pane Items` in core setting, `github` package will keep multi blank `unstaged changes` panes open after stage. If `Allow Pending` of this package is set to false, user can open the file in permanent pane by single click and not have the blank pane problem of github package.\n\n### 1.0.1\n- update readme\n",
