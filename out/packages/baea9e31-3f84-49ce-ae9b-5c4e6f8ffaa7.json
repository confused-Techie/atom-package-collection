Perhaps, then, the plethora of code didn't feel long enough to merit breaking into separate files. It happens. It felt right. But now, it's anarchy and it feels so wrong.\n\n#### But It Doesn't Have To:\nDirectories allow easy file navigation without the use of additional packages.\n\nBy creating a directory at the start of each file, you can begin to portion off your code with section comments and index them up top. And with the use of special characters at the start of each section's title, you can easily \"cmd + d\" straight down to the needed section from the directory without picking up lines containing the same phrase.\n\nSections create space and focus.\n\nBy making section comments purposely \"chunky\", not only are blocks of code more easily found, but the distance created makes lengthy files feel less intimidating and more approachable.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\nAtom Package: https://atom.io/packages/directory-comments\n\n```bash\napm install directory-comments\n```\nOr Preferences ➔ Install ➔ Search for `directory-comments`\n\n## Release Notes\nFor release notes and version history, view the [change log](https://github.com/heycalaway/directory-comments/blob/master/changelog.md#change-log).",
