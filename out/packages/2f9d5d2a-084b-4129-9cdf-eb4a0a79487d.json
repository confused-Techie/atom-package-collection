    "readme": "# LaTeX Tree\n\nDocument tree view for LaTeX.\n\n![LaTeX Tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphael-cch/latex-tree/master/latex-tree-screenshot.png)\n\n## Features\n* Display a document tree according to the `part`, `chapter`, `section`, `subsection`, `subsubsection`, `paragraph` and `subparagraph` labels in a LaTeX document.\n* (Hopefully) accurate generation of tree view items, taking into account comments, line breaks, weird symbols etc in the title, and will ignore commented lines in the document (see example in screenshot above).\n* Clicking an item in the tree view will position the cursor (and scroll the text editor) to the corresponding position in the LaTeX file.\n* Text editor would be focused after clicking on the tree view, so you can move your cursor or start typing right away (can be turned off in settings).\n* The corresponding item in the tree view would be highlighted according to the current cursor position (can be turned off in settings).\n* Support for multi-file LaTeX documents using `\\include` and `\\input` (more details [below](https://github.com/raphael-cch/latex-tree#multi-file-support))\n\n## Basics\n#### Installation\nSearch `latex-tree` on the 'Install' page of Settings, then click 'Install'.\n\n#### Displaying the tree view\nUse the `Latex Tree: Toggle Tree View` command in the command palette.\nAlternatively, use the keybinding `ctrl-alt-m` (`cmd-alt-m` for macOS) to toggle the tree view.\n[You can change the default keybinding too.](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#customizing-keybindings)\n\n#### Multi-file support\nThis package supports LaTeX documents with multiple files using the commands\n```\n\\include{relative-file-path}\n```\nor\n```\n\\input{relative-or-absolute-file-path}\n```\nor `\\import`, `\\subimport`, `\\inputfrom`, `\\subinputfrom`, `\\includefrom`, `\\subincludefrom` (from the [import package](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/import)).\nYou could also specify the main root file by using the \"TeX Magic Comment\"\n```\n% !TEX root = ../main.tex\n```\nat the beginning of **each subfile** included by the main root file\n(see the [documentation for the `latex` package](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/wiki/Overridding-Build-Settings) for more details).\nThis would cause the document tree to be generated from the main root file instead of the current file.\n\n## Settings\n#### Update Frequency\nThis is the frequency for which the document tree view should be updated.\nIf you experience lags when you type, try lowering the update frequency or changing to *On Save Only*.\nYou can choose between:<br/>\n**High**: tree view will be updated very shortly after you stop typing. (note: this setting uses Atom's [`onDidStopChanging`](https://atom.io/docs/api/latest/TextEditor#instance-onDidStopChanging) event)<br/>\n**Medium**: tree view will not update more than every 0.5s.<br/>\n**Low**: tree view will not update more than every 2s.<br/>\n**On Save Only**: tree view will only update when you save the document.\n\n#### Focus Editor After Clicking\nThis could be disabled if you do not want to focus back to the current text editor after clicking an item in the tree view.\n\n#### Highlight Tree View Item according to current Cursor Position\nThis could be disabled if you do not want the corresponding item in the tree view to be highlighted according to the current cursor position. If you experience lags when you move the cursor, try disabling this option.\n\n## Issues\nIf you experience any problems with this package, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/raphael-cch/latex-tree/issues).\n\n## License\nGPL-3.0\n```\nlatex-tree: Document tree view for LaTeX.\nCopyright (C) 2017-2018 Raphael Chung\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\nany later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
