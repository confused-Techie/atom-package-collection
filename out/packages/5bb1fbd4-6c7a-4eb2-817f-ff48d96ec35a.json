    "readme": "# moth-mono-syntax theme\n\nA sober dark syntax theme for Atom, part of Moth's [FONC YOU](https://germanponte.com/moth/foncyou/) collection.\n\nSee the socially-inept nerd at color school, bullied by the popular Base16 and Monokai kids. He jumped the fence for grayer pastures and has been on the League of Achromatic Merit ever since.\n\n![Moth Mono Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73740741/97789052-c1da2500-1bbd-11eb-9dcd-d1c489591403.png)\n\n`Font: Inconsolata / UI: One Dark / CSS colors: highlight-colors by brumm (not part of the theme)`\n\nMoth Mono proposes an alternative of subtle grayscale variations that fades out of the way and lets a Zen-like state of mind descend upon the coding guru. A theme to focus on essence.\n\n## Features\n\n+ Grayscale monochrome.\n+ Color in editor only.\n+ Medium contrast.\n+ Medium brightness.\n+ Reduced halation.\n+ No font variations, except in .md source.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n+ In Atom, go to *Settings* > *Install*.\n+ Click the `Themes` button and search for `moth-mono`.\n+ Browse the results for `moth-mono-syntax` and click `Install`.\n+ Go back to *Settings*, click *Themes*.\n+ In the drop-down menu under \"Syntax Theme\", choose \"moth-mono-syntax\".\n\n## FONC YOU\n\nMoth's FONC YOU (Few Or No Colors Yield Optimal Usage) collection is a sedate approach to Atom syntax highlighting for those who wish to engage in chromatic austerity.\n\nDark themes:\n\n+ [Cathode](https://github.com/moth-g/cathode-syntax)\n+ [Moth One](https://github.com/moth-g/moth-one-syntax)\n+ *Moth Mono*\n+ [Moth Dark](https://github.com/moth-g/moth-dark-syntax)\n\nLight Themes:\n\n+ [Anode](https://github.com/moth-g/anode-syntax)\n+ [Moth Light](https://github.com/moth-g/moth-light-syntax)\n\nLearn more and see the themes in action at the [FONC YOU web page](https://germanponte.com/moth/foncyou/).\n",
