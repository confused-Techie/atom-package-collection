    "readme": "# chrome-color-picker\nA color picker inspired by chrome's dev tools color picker (or [spectrum](https://github.com/bgrins/spectrum) color picker)\n\n[![Join us on the Atom Community on Slack](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/puranjayjain/chrome-color-picker.svg)](https://gitter.im/puranjayjain/chrome-color-picker?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\n\n**Always mention the relevant person with @username**\n\n## Preview\n![Demo Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puranjayjain/chrome-color-picker/master/demo.gif)\n\n**Note: The color highlight or marker is not part of this package, to obtain that functionality we use [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments) and the syntax theme is [chrome-dark-syntax](https://atom.io/packages/chrome-dark-syntax)**\n\n# Install\n## Using `apm`:\n\n```\napm install chrome-color-picker\n```\n## Using Atom\nSearch for `chrome color picker` in Atom Settings (`Settings > Install > Search`).\n\n# Simple Usage\n- Open the dialog using the shortcut key or using the context menu\n- Press Escape to close it.\n<br>**or**\n- Press Enter to update the color\n\n# Features\n## Use Colors in these formats\n* HEX\n* Named ([Web colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#X11_color_names))\n* RGB\n* RGBa\n* RGB and RGBa %\n* RGB and RGBa ratios\n* HSL\n* HSLa\n* HSL and HSLa ratios\n\n## Integrated Palette\n- Use the palette with the picker as done in dev tools.\n- Contains the [material design palette](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html) by default.\n- Click any palette swatch to select it.\n- Double click any material palette swatch to expand it (except black or white swatch).\n\n## Accessibility\nYou can use the entire picker using just the keyboard.<br>\nUse these keys for navigating within the component:\n* `Escape`: To close the picker\n* `Escape`: To save the value to the editor\n* `Tab`: To move to the next part where action can be performed (e.g. button, slider, etc.)\n* `Shift + Tab`: To move to the previous part where action can be performed (e.g. button, slider, etc.)\n* `Space`: Do the action\n\nThere are more actions that are possible with keys and mouse\n\n### Slide using scroll\nYou can use the mouse wheel to scroll on the sliders and the main canvas to change the values.\nYou can also do the following:\n- Use `ctrl + wheel` to increment more value.\n- Use `shift + wheel` to slide from left to right or vice-versa on the main slider (or canvas).\n- Similarly Use `ctrl + shift + wheel` to increment more value.\n\n**Note: ctrl also means cmd in Unix based operating systems like Linux or OS X**\n\n### Slide using arrow keys\nYou can use the arrow keys to scroll on the sliders and the main canvas to change the values.\nYou can also do the following:\n- Use `ctrl + arrowKey` to increment more value.\n- All four arrow keys are usable on the main slider.\n- Only Right and Left Arrow keys are usable on the slider hue and alpha.\n\n## Supports multiple cursors [Beta]\nWhen you have multiple cursors it inserts the color in each of their locations\n\n## Color Picking from screen [Beta]\nYou can now pick colors from anywhere on the screen\n\n**Note: Features marked [Beta] are not stable and might not work as expected so feel free to point out any issues with them**\n\n# Powered by\nThe plugin uses the following projects (or their sources) or technologies in some manner:\n- [Custom Elements](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements)\n- [https://github.com/js2coffee/js2coffee](https://github.com/js2coffee/js2coffee) to convert the code\n-

[https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) for working with colors\n- [https://github.com/desandro/draggabilly](https://github.com/desandro/draggabilly) for sliding across the main canvas\n- [https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap)\n-

[keymap](http://flight-manual.atom.io/behind-atom/sections/keymaps-in-depth/) file and add this line to it:\n```CoffeeScript\n'atom-workspace':\n  'your-keybinding': 'chrome-color-picker:toggle'\n```\n**Note: Your key binding can be e.g. `alt + ctrl + c` and also make sure to disable the default key binding from the package's settings or resolve it using the key binding resolver**\n\n## The commands that are supported currently are:\n* chrome-color-picker:toggle        - triggers dialog open/close\n* chrome-color-picker:close         - triggers dialog close\n* chrome-color-picker:save          - triggers the color to be updated back to the editor\n* chrome-color-picker:saveAndClose  - triggers the color to be updated back to the editor and closed after that\n* chrome-color-picker:pickcolor     - toggle the color picker eyedropper tool to pick colors from screen\n\n# Purpose to create\nThis implementation was built from ground up to:\n- Aid web developers to work with colors more easily and in a friendly environment\n- To learn about the hsv color model\n- Learn more of [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org)\n\n# FAQs\n\n#### 1) I am seeing strange settings which I'm not able to edit\n\n**Solution**\n  1. Open the developer tools in atom (View > Developers > Toggle Developer Mode or Using `ctrl + alt + i`)\n\n  2. Enter this command in the developer tools console `atom.config.unset('chrome-color-picker')` and restart atom\n\n#### 2) How do I know which settings override which ones?\n\n**Solution**\n  - Although there is no guide (yet) for the specificity of settings or which settings are above which ones.\nBut you can know about some of them [here](https://github.com/puranjayjain/chrome-color-picker/blob/master/lib/modules/core/Input.coffee#L163)\n\nFeel free to update the [wiki](https://github.com/puranjayjain/chrome-color-picker/wiki/Setting's-specificity) with your findings.\n\n#### 3) Do you mind feature requests or suggestions?\n\n**Solution**<br><br>\nThey are always welcome, even if they are present in the [milestone](https://github.com/puranjayjain/chrome-color-picker/milestones)\n\n#### 4) Help! the picker won't open !\n\n**Solution**<br><br>\nTry restarting atom or closing and opening atom or reloading atom (`View > Developer > Reload Window`)\n\n# Versioning\n\nFor transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, package is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/).
