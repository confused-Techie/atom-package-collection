Take a screenshot or copy an image to the clipboard.\n2. Paste it into Atom AsciiDoc editor.\n3. See that the _'Images Folder'_ has a new png file, and an image reference was inserted into the editor with the correct filename.\n\nThe default setting is to place copied and created a folder named `images` in the same folder as the document.  \nAnother default setting is to expect that the `:imagesdir:` attribute is **not** set in the document (or through cli) and sets the _'Append Images Folder'_ setting to `true`. This setting will append the Images Folder path to the filename in the `image:[]` macro so that AsciiDoctor knows where to find the files.\n\n**NOTE:** To increase flexibility for moving your images folder, and to also reduce the repetition of hard coded image folder strings in the document; it is recommended to set the `:imagesdir:` attribute for your document to match the _'Images Folder'_ setting in this package and to disable the _'Append Images Folder'_ option.  \nThis way, the package will know where to place your image files, and asciidoctor will know where to find them.\n\nIf you want to move your folder of images into a new directory called something like `assets` you would change the Folder Location string to `assets/images`, and set this same thing as the value of the `:imagesdir:` attribute in the document.  \nMake sure the setting to _'Append Images Folder_' is not checked.  \nNow everything should just work as expected in the new location, without requiring a Find/Replace operation over all of the documents that have hard coded the images folder into the image macros.\n\n### Notes for Windows Users\n\n#### To take a screenshot to the clipboard.\n\nUse `PrintScr` to capture your entire desktop.  \nUse `Alt + PrintScr` to capture the active window.  \n\n#### When copying an existing file on your local system into the document.\n\n1. Open Windows Explorer and find your file.\n2. Press `Shift` and `right-click` with your mouse.\n3. Your pop up menu will have several more options.\n4. Select Copy as Path.\n5. Paste into the editor.\n\n### Notes for Mac OS X Users\n\n#### To take a screenshot to the clipboard.\n\nUse `Command-Shift-Control-4` to capture the image data to the clipboard.\n\n#### When copying an existing file on your local system into the document.\n\n1. Navigate to the file or folder you wish to copy the path for.\n2. `Right-click` (or `Control+Click`, or a _Two-Finger click_ on trackpads) on the file in the Mac Finder.\n3. While in the right-click menu, hold down the OPTION key to reveal the _\"Copy (item name) as Pathname\"_ option, it replaces the standard Copy option.\n4. Once selected, the file or folders path is now in the clipboard, ready to be pasted into the document.  \n**Note:** The copied pathname is always the complete path, it’s not relative.\n\n## Install\n\nSettings/Preferences > Install > Search for `asciidoc-image-helper`\n\nor\n\n```bash\napm install asciidoc-image-helper\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nSpecial thank you to [Ludovic Fernandez '_ldez_'](https://github.com/ldez) for turning this package into a legit project. I am learning a lot from his pull requests.\n",
