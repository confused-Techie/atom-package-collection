Once a\nconstruct is pick from the select view, the selection in the buffer will be\nsurrounded with the construct, and the overall text will be properly indented.\n\nThere is **no default binding** for the package. The user can either call the\npackage from the command palette as `surround-with:surround`, or a new entry can\nbe placed in the `keymap.cson` file:\n\n```\n'atom-workspace atom-text-editor:not([mini])':\n  'ctrl-alt-o': 'surround-with:surround'\n```\n\n## Supported languages\n- [x] C/C++\n- [x] Java\n- [x] JavaScript\n- [x] CoffeeScript\n- [x] C#\n- [ ] Go\n- [ ] Objective-C\n- [ ] Perl\n- [ ] PHP\n- [x] Python\n- [ ] Ruby\n\n## :rotating_light: Disclaimer :rotating_light:\nThis package is available in the Atom package repository, still it is under\nheavy development, thus not recommended for production usage. Any help is\nheavily appreciated, as well as issues and suggestions!\n",
