    "readme": "# pokeinfo package\n\n*Wanna know basic Pokémon's info right in hand?*\n\nThis is an [Atom](https://atom.io/) package to provide Pokémon's info of a selected word (in case it is a Pokémon).\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/pokeinfo/blob/master/imgs/poke.png\" width=\"60%\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/pokeinfo/blob/master/imgs/data.png\" width=\"60%\">\n\n\n## Usage 💻\n\nBy selecting a word, or just by having the cursor over a word; just press `Ctrl + Alt + p` to activate the PokeSearch of the package.\n\n## How it works ⚙️\n\nThe package directly interacts with the [Pokéapi](https://pokeapi.co/), by consuming the API searching for info of the selected word. In case the word selected is a Pokémon, it will display that Pokémon's info. If it is not, it will just say it is not a Pokémon.\n\n## LICENSE\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Rodolfo Ferro\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
