I've selected a few here that I feel apply equally well to\nwriting fiction in YAML/Markdown using Atom.\n\n* [advanced-open-file](https://atom.io/packages/advanced-open-file) to\n  quickly create new files.\n* [document-outline](https://atom.io/packages/document-outline) to\n  display a hierarchical, interactive outline tree view for document\n  markup.\n* [editorconfig](https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig) to maintain\n  consistent Markdown / YAML styles across editors.\n* [linter-languagetool](https://atom.io/packages/linter-languagetool) for\n  spell & grammar checking using LanguageTool (you'll need to install\n  LanguageTool separately).\n* [typewriter](https://atom.io/packages/typewriter) to center the\n  text in the editor.\n* [wordcount](https://atom.io/packages/wordcount) because you just\n  need this as a writer.\n* [wrap-with-anything](https://atom.io/packages/wrap-with-anything) to\n  text selections instead of replacing them when certain characters are\n  typed.\n* [zen](https://atom.io/packages/Zen) for distraction free writing.\n",
