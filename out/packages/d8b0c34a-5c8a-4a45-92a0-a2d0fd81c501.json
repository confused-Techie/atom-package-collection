    "readme": "# Quick Hyperlink\n\nSometimes you just need to select some text and make it a link. With this, you can select text, press the shortcut, and it will create an anchor element wrapped around the selected text, and take whatever is in the clipboard and set it as the `href` attribute.\n\nTo use it, select some text, hit `Ctrl` + `option` + L in Mac (`Ctrl` + `Alt` + L in Windows/PC), to make the selected text part of an anchor tag, with the `href` attribute containing the value of whatever was in the clipboard.\n\n# Markdown Support\n\nMarkdown supports its own syntax, but you can add html too. So for editing markdown, a command for adding a markdown style link is also added here.\n\nTo make a markdown style link, select some text, hit `Ctrl` + `option` + M in Mac (`Ctrl` + `Alt` + M in Windows/PC). This will make your selected text into a markdown style link (with the link being whatever is in copied in your clipboard)\n",
