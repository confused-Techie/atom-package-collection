    "readme": "# double-click-tree-view package for atom editor\n\nBy default, the atom tree-view for browsing files/directories will open a file or collapse / expand\na directory listing just by single-clicking on the entry.\n\nThis package allows the user to choose single or double click on a file to open it, or on a directory to expand/collapse it. This effectively turns a single-click into just selecting the item clicked on, which is the default behavior in most editors.\n\nTips: if `Allow Pending Pane Items` in `Settings/Core` is set to false and `Enable on file` of this package setting is set to false, single click on file will open the file.\n\nTo install:\n\n```apm install dbclick-tree-view```\n\n\n\nBig thanks to mattsfrey and h2so5 for writing the original projects that this has been forked from.\n\nhttps://github.com/h2so5/atom-chary-tree-view\n\nhttps://github.com/mattsfrey/atom-double-click-tree-view\n",
