    "readme": "# Atom Command/Ctrl swapper\n\nRemaps `Command` key to `Control` and vice versa.\n\n## Why ##\n\nI have to move back and forth between Linxu and MacOS. It's almost\nimpossible to have the perfect key binding on MacOS. Yet, I like to make MacOS\nto behave like Linux rather than the opposite. So there two solutions:\n\n### Swap Command and Ctrl at OS Level\n\nIt's [easily possible](https://superuser.com/questions/250611/mac-os-change-command-to-control-key)\nin MacOS to swap `Command` and `Ctrl` but I can't select\ndefault XWin keybinding for my IntelliJ and the MacOS one is so different.\n\n### Key defaults and define shortcuts\n\nIt's possible to define shortcuts for general operations like\nCopy/Paste/... on Mac and map them to Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, ...\n\nThen I can use Default XWin keybinding on IntelliJ but then\nAtom is not happy! Atom has different default key bindings base\non the operating system which is running on. It doesn't make sense\nto define all Atom shortcuts and replace `Command` with `Ctrl`.\n\nSo I created this package!\n\n## How to use\n\nInstall the package\n\n```\napm install atom-swap-command-ctrl\n```\n\nToggle the package by either:\n\n- `Cmd-Shift-P` and then `Atom Swap Command Control: Toggle`\n- Navigate to menu choose `Packages -> Swap Command/Ctrl -> Toggle`\n\nToggle again to go back to normal mode (turns of the swapper).\n",
