    "readme": "# Mark-ring Atom package\n\nEasily create multiple cursors without your mouse.\n\n![A screencast of mark-ring in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JHonaker/mark-ring/master/mark-ring.gif)\n\nThis package allows you to create multiple cursors in places other than simply above and below the current cursors. All you need to remember is one easy-to-use shortcut that does everything!\n\n## Features\n\n* Mark your cursor location with a keyboard shortcut\n* Use the mouse or keyboard to place another cursor\n* No need to worry about moving cursors by accident\n* Platform independent keyboard shortcuts\n\n## Installation\n\nUse apm: `apm install mark-ring`\n\nOr install through the Atom setting menu.\n\n## Shortcuts and Commands\n\nThe available commands for binding are:\n\n* `mark-ring:mark-or-recall` - The main \"do it all\" command\n* `mark-ring:view-marks` - Will open the mark view popover\n* `mark-ring:mark-cursor` - Will *only* mark under the cursor\n* `mark-ring:clear-marks` - Will clear all marks\n* `mark-ring:recall-marks` - Will recall all marks, but not clear them\n\nYou only need `mark-ring:mark-or-recall` to use this package. It will mark under your cursor, but if there is a mark already there, it wil clear and recall all marks.\n\nBy default only these keybindings are set up:\n\n##### Mac\n\n* `CMD-SHIFT-M`: `mark-ring:mark-or-recall`\n* `CMD-SHIFT-V`: `mark-ring:view-marks`\n\n##### Windows/Linux\n\n* `CTRL-SHIFT-M`: `mark-ring:mark-or-recall`\n* `CTRL-SHIFT-V`: `mark-ring:view-marks`\n\nThe rest are still available through the command palette or you own custom keybindings.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or ideas, open an issue or submit a pull request!\n\n## Acknowledgements:\n\nThis package was inspired by the [Must Have Packages That Don't Exist thread](https://discuss.atom.io/t/must-have-packages-that-dont-exist/12665) and the [MarkAndMove SublimeText package](https://github.com/colinta/SublimeMarkAndMove).\n\nI heavily borrowed from the [atom-bookmarks](https://github.com/atom/bookmarks) package. The code in that package was instrumental getting this to work.\n",
