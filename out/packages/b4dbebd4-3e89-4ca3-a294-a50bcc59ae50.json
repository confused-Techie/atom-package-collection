    "readme": "# geany-syntax Theme\n![Geany Editor](http://www.geany.org/images/geany.png)\n\nA simple light syntax theme to mimic the [Geany Editor](http://www.geany.org/). Works with light themes. Work in progress. One variant is the brace match which uses some fancy animation I grabbed from this link [Brace Matching](https://discuss.atom.io/t/where-to-set-the-matched-brace-color/12372/18) which has some other tips on brace match. Some differences in how CSS is displayed, but it's better then the default Geany highlighter. In general where the Atom syntax highligher did a better job I left some of that in.\n\nI only looked at sample PHP, HTML, CSS files to check colors, but more could be done for other supported languages.\n# Revisions\n* V1.0.1 Changed Folding indicator to be a `+` to expand `-` fold.\n* V1.0.1 Fixed botched commit, now has gutter color highligher for folded lines.\n\n# Screenshot\n![A screenshot of your theme](http://i.imgur.com/7KGns27.png)\n",
