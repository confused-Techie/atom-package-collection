    "readme": "# snytax\ni hate syntax highlighters  \ni really do  \nrepo name is not a typo  \n\n\nthis is an attempt to create a syntax highlighting theme for atom that i find okay. i will base it on a style guide i created for university math scripts, which aren't at all like code. but i had a few ideas doing that which i want to use.\n\n## general ideas (tbc)\n* too many colours are shit and mainly irritate you. don't do that.\n  * if the colours are not structuring but destructuring your code, they probably should be adjusted.\n  * use such a small number of colours that you actually recognise them individually and they will actually _help_ you at coding. maybe a max of 4 or so. idk.\n  * this also means the highlighting will be very personally adjusted to _me_ and how _i_ program and it will develop over time. fork for your own flavour.\n* colours should have a more general meaning. like, not just one syntax thing, but maybe a group of things that have familiar associations.\n  * this can probably be quite personal as well. i don't even know.\n  * example: green means ~~clean.~~ definition. and maybe even assignments.\n* if you associate meanings to colours: *use them!* this is a great way to help your mind, as it already has the right associations.\n\n## concrete ideas\ni'm doing this highlighting for js, so this is what i'll base my examples on.\ni thought of the following 4 groups and colours:\n* standard (colour: black or white)\n  * this group is the one that has the \"standard text\" inside it and renders monochrome\n  * this means inside it should be the stuff that is most used in our language and \"not anything special\"\n  * BUT: To seperate all the \"non-special\" things from each other we can use font weight and stuff\n  * in my mind this means:\n    * names (of variables and constants)\n    * ~~language keywords [bold]~~ this did not work out, i added an extra color for that (q_q)\n    * comments [lighter font weight than standard, italic]\n* assignments (colour: green)\n  * this group is for \"writing stuff into a thing with a name\"\n  * in my mind this means:\n    * assigning a value to a thing with a name. in js this means the = character: `y = 'abc';` has `y` and `''` from the keyword group and `=` from assignment group.\n    * name definitions: when a name gets defined, like in `const x = 15;`: `const` is a keyword, `x =` is both in the definition group.\n* literals (colour: blue)\n  * this group is for \"writing a literal value\"\n  * in my mind this means:\n    * numbers\n    * strings (but beware: \" \", \\` \\`, / / and so on are language keywords, so they have a different colour)\n    * bools (true/false)\n    * object literals (this weird json-y thing in js)\n* function calls (colour: red)\n  * this group is for the action of calling a function (not just the name of one, a non-invoked name is in the standard group)\n  * in my mind this means:\n    * names that get invoked. example `awesomeSnytax(value);`. `awesomeSnytax` should be red, parantheses are standard group though.\n    * infix operators, like `===` and `||` and `&`, these are also just function calls that take arguments from the left and right side and return something.\n* keywords (colour: yellowish-orange and [bold])\n  * i wish i didn't have to make this group but variables and keywords in the same group was too confusing.\n\n##screenshot\nthis is my progress so far. probably looks shitty in other languages and is still bugged i guess.  \nthe parentheses after if/while/etc shouldn't be red, but there was nothing i could do about that for now.  \n![Screenshot of Snytax](https://github.com/remhume/snytax/raw/master/screenshot.png \"screenshot of snytax\")\n\n## FAQBM\n(frequently asked questions by myself)\n\n### when will you start actually making the thing?\n~~idk. maybe tomorrow. or the day after. or next week. maybe not at all, if that's the case just feel inspired and fork this or do your own. i don't care.~~  \nha, i already started!\n### why are you using UK english?\nidk. it felt appropriate for somehow ranting about shitty syntax highlighters.\n",
