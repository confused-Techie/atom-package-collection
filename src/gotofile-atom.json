  "readme": "# atom-gotofile package\n\nOpen Atom with the appropriate source file with the code for the current HTML Node.\n\n## Use Case\n\nThis is a plugin that enables you to go directly from chrome to the right file\nin your editor (atom right now!).\n\nImagine you are working on a web application that has many pages and hence you have\norganized your code into many files. Assume that you want to edit your login form.\nRun your application, Connect chrome and atom (shown below), navigate\nto login section, right click on the appropriate element, Go To File - should open\nthe right file responsible for the code for that element. This provides a more visual way\nto jump between sections of your application.\n\n## Setup\n\nFirstly, you need to add this babel plugin [babel-plugin-transform-jsx-include-source](https://github.com/ganarajpr/babel-plugin-transform-jsx-include-source). The link has the instructions of how to add it and setup the `.babelrc`.\n\nOnce this is setup, please ensure that the final rendered html (most elements)\n has a `data-source` property by Inspecting elements.\n\nNow install this [Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gotofile/dailfineomdkebihodfameiejgbnglil) and this [Atom Plugin] (https://atom.io/packages/gotofile-atom). The Atom plugin can also be installed as `apm install gotofile-atom`. ( You might need to install Shell Commands from atom before using the shell command.)\n\nOnce all the plugins are installed, open the project folder from Atom ( assuming this is your editor, it should\n  already be open). Now, start the `Go to File` server by activating it through the menu / context-menu (see screenshot).\n",
