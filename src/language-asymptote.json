  "readme": "## Synopsis\n\nAsymptote is a powerful C-based Vector Graphics Language that can be integrated into LaTeX documents. This package adds syntax highlighting functionality to Atom, a text editor. Other features such as automatic compile are planned, but not yet implemented.\n\nHere are an example of the syntax highlighter in action:\n\n![Screenshot 1](https://github.com/supakorn-ras/language-asymptote/raw/master/images/demo1.png)\n\nThe official website of Asymptote is at http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe idea for Asymptote syntax highlighter was conceived during one of my study sessions. I was working for an assignment for Honours Calculus 2, and I needed a way to draw images digitally on LaTeX files since my drawing skills weren't good. So, I discovered Asymptote, which is a powerful vector graphics language (which I found easier to use than TikZ), however there weren't any language packages for Atom at the moment, and I found that managing asy documents is difficult due to lack of keyword emphasizing. So I've developed this package to help mitigate this difficulty.\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst of all, Atom is necessary for Installation. To install, clone this repository and copy the contents to %userprofile%/.atom/packages/language-asymptote. Restart Atom and all .asy files should be highlighted.\n\nIn case of a new asymptote version, new grammar files can be generated by running ```./generate_asy_grammar.sh``` on macOS/Linux or ```generate_asy_grammar.ps1``` on Windows machines. The new ```asymptote.cson``` will be generated in the correct directory. In case of a bug or error with the new file, a backup version is provided with ```asymptote.cson.old```. Simply rename the file to ```asymptote.cson``` to revert back to the manually generated version.\n\n## Contributors\n\nApart from me, John Bowman helped with Asymptote keywords and grammar generation.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nJohn Bowman, Andy Hammerlindl and Tom Prince, and other students for development of the original Asymptote language. The full credits can be seen at http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Supakorn Rassameemasmuang See LICENSE.md for more details.\n\nThis project uses derivative code built from Asymptote, which can be retrieved under https://github.com/vectorgraphics/asymptote.\n",
