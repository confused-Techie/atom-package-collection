  "readme": "# pastel-cutie-syntax theme\n\nJust a cute pastel Atom syntax theme for guys, gals, and nonbinary pals. Configured mainly with front-end/web development in mind (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), but should work with other languages as well! Font pictured is Cartograph CF, but only because I was able to con my boss into buying me a license. Please forgive this nonsense sample code; trying to get barba.js to play nicely with Wordpress is an ongoing struggle.\n\n\n![A screenshot of your theme](pastel-cutie-screenshot.png)\n",
