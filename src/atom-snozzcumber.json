  "readme": "# Snozzcumber!\n\nLorem Ipsum for Atom, with a Roald Dahl twist.  It's yet another dummy text\ngenerator.  But this one uses phrases from Roald Dahl stories.\n\n> Try it yourself this foulsome snozzcumber!\n\nIt's based on the [Snozzcumber Javascript library](https://paulhorner79.github.io/snozzcumber/)\n\n![The BFG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulhorner79/atom-snozzcumber/master/bfg.jpg \"The BFG\")\n\n## From the library\n\nIf like me you use a lot of dummy text when building your projects, but hate\nseeing \"Lorem Ipsum\" all over your pages, this might be for you.  It generates\nreal-looking, fun text drawn from an array of Roald Dahl books.\n\n> I realise that this means that there might be some copyright issues here.\nThis was developed as a bit of fun, and certainly not for commercial gain. If\nyou are the copyright holder and want this removing from circulation please\ncontact me and I'll remove it as soon as possible.\n\nThe phrases were taken from the following webpages:\n\n- https://www.google.co.uk/amp/m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_57d74c2de4b09d7a687f6b35/amp\n- http://www.stylist.co.uk/books/the-greatest-roald-dahl-book-quotes-for-all-moments-in-adult-life\n\nAny inaccuracies are theirs and not mine!\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use this, load the command panel, type \"Snozzcumber\" and choose the relevant\noption.  You probably only actually need to type \"snoz\" to see the options -\nthere aren't a lot of other packages with a similar name.\n\nAlternatively you can right click and choose \"Snozzcumber\", or choose\n\"Snozzcumber\" from the Packages menu.  The available options are:\n\n- **Phrase** - Chooses a random Roald Dahl phrase.\n- **Paragraph** - Generates a paragraph based on a random number of phrases.\n- **Paragraphs** - Prints out n paragraphs, where n is set in the config.\n\n## Config options\n\nThere are a number of configuration options:\n\n### Number of Paragraphs\n\nThe number of paragraphs to generate when running the 'paragraphs' command\".\n\nThe default value is 4.\n\n### HTML Extensions\nYou can also specify a list of file extensions where any paragraphs generated\nwill be wrapped in HTML `<p> </p>` tags.  This option is a list of file\nextensions for HTML file types.\n\nThe default values are:\n- .html\n- .htm (does anyone still use this?)\n- .php (I'm not sure whether this should be included here or not, but you can\noverride it if you want to)\n- .twig (Twig templates)\n- .tpl (Smarty templates)\n\nWhen adding others, these should be added in lowercase, and remember to include\nthe opening '.'\n",
