  "readme": "# electron-cannon theme\n\nA smooth dark theme built mainly for C# programming. But, can obviously be used with any language, especially with a little bit of customisation.\n\n\nIf you would like to customise this theme, check out the colors.less file.\nMy comments are based on my findings in a small sample of languages, including:\n.cs    .cpp    .html    .css    .js    .json    .py\nSo there may be a few issues with the comments, but still may help with any customisation.\nIf any elements appear black, check the colors.less file, it is explained.\n\n\n![Theme in action](https://i.imgur.com/IOF2gqZ.png)\n",
