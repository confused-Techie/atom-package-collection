  "readme": "# Atom UI Theme Template\n\nThis is a __starter template__ for creating an Atom UI theme.\n\nThis template only includes the __minimum of styling__ needed and comes with a neutral look. It could already be used as a real theme, but its purpose is to serve as a basis for creating your own theme. It is documented throughout and invites you to make changes to your liking. For some inspiration take a look at other Atom themes at [atom.io/themes](https://atom.io/themes/). Or you're always free to fork a theme that already comes close to your vision.\n\nHappy theming! ðŸš€\n\n\n## Getting started\n\n1. Fork this repository.\n2. Continue with step 2 from [Creating a UI Theme](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/creating-a-theme/#creating-a-ui-theme)\n\nIf you get stuck somewhere, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/atom-community/ui-theme-template/issues/new).\n\nps. Don't forget to delete the above and edit the below in your own `README.md`.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# My UI theme\n\nA short description of your theme.\n\n![A screenshot of your theme](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/8842525/4215f26c-3136-11e5-9d94-d2c078a05d24.png)\n",
