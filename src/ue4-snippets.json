  "readme": "# ue4-snippets package\n\nAdds useful snippets for working with Unreal Engine 4 C++ Code.  \nThis is especially useful on Linux, as auto-completion in IDEs seems to fail a lot due to UE4s huge codebase.  \nAll snippets start with the letter *u*, so if you're looking for all the snippets, just type that and explore :)  \n\n### Currently includes snippets for:\n* print strings to screen\n* print messages to log\n* spawn emitters at location / attached\n* play sounds at location / attached\n* spawn actors\n* spawn actors deferred\n* safely get world (with if check, needed for spawning things)\n* create UEnums\n* create UStructs\n* create UClasses (as if you ever needed to but why not)\n* cast UObjects\n* uproperty and ufunction macro\n* creating default subobjects (components)\n* single & multi linetrace by channel/object/profile\n* single & multi overlap by channel/object/profile\n* multi sweep by channel/object/profile\n* set timer & clear timer\n* input axis & input action binding\n* subclass pointer\n* replication functions\n* getting all actors of a class\n* finding Datatable rows\n* creating SaveGames\n* loading SaveGames\n* saving SaveGames\n",
