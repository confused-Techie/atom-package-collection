  "readme": "# autocomplete-tailwind\n\n__NOTE:__ This package is forked from [vinkla/autocomplete-tailwind](https://github.com/vinkla/autocomplete-tailwind), where it has been archived and abandoned by the previous owner.\n\nThe project is now in a state of maintenance; there is no active development. If you're here because you are using this project but the completions list is not up to date, feel free to make a pull request!\n\n## Manually Installing this Atom Package\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/bitmanic/atom-tailwindcss.git\ncd atom-tailwindcss\nnpm install\nnpm run build\napm install\napm link .\n```\n\n## Creating a New Release\n\nThe following process should be followed to create a new release of this package. (I'm writing these words just as much for myself as I am for anyone interested in sending a PR.)\n\n```shell\n# If the project's not set up yet:\ngit clone https://github.com/bitmanic/atom-tailwindcss.git\ncd atom-tailwindcss\nnpm install\n\n# Grab the latest version of Tailwind CSS\nnpm update tailwindcss\n\n# Run a script to update the `src/completions.json` file\nnpm run build\n\n# Run tests to make sure the update hasn't broken anything\nnpm run test\n\n# Perform a manual visual inspection of the completions\ngit diff src/completions.json\n```\n\nIf nothing has failed and the inspection goes well enough, you're ready to create a new version! All this means is that you crack open `package.json` and bump the version number. After that's done, send a pull request!\n\n[MIT](LICENSE) Â© [Ray Brown](https://raybrown.co)\n",
