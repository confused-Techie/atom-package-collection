  "readme": "# Atom: pane-manager\n\n> Set your panes layout, move your files between them, and other useful pane-related stuffs.\n\n* * *\n\n## WARNING: breaking changes in `1.0`!\n\nIf you used this package before its `1.0` version, you need to read the following documentation: commands name have changed and keybindings have been disabled to make overriding easier.\n\n* * *\n\n## Keybindings\n\nWith the success of Atom, it's really difficult to choose keybindings that will not enter in conflict whit anyone else's packages, so I have removed the default keystrokes and let the keymap empty to let you set your own keybindings.\n\nSee [keymaps/pane-manager.cson](https://github.com/leny/atom-pane-manager/blob/master/keymaps/pane-manager.cson) for suggestions.\n\n## Features\n\n### Change pane layouts\n\nUse commands `pane-manager:change-layout-[number]` to switch between layouts (`[number]` can be one of the following : `one`, `two`, `three`, `four`, `five`, `six`, `seven`, `eight`, `nine`, `ten`).\n\n#### Customize layouts\n\nUsing the following config parameters, you can customize your pane layouts (following are defaults).\n\n* `layout-one`: `[ 1 ]` (one column, one row)\n* `layout-two`: `[ 1, 1 ]` (two columns, one row)\n* `layout-three`: `[ 1, 1, 1 ]` (three columns, one row)\n* `layout-four`: `[ 1, 1, 1, 1 ]` (four columns, one row)\n* `layout-five`: `[ 2, 2 ]` (two columns, two rows)\n* `layout-six`: `[ 2, 2, 2 ]` (three columns, two rows)\n* `layout-seven`: `[ 1, 2 ]` (two columns, last one splitted in two rows)\n* `layout-eight`: `[ 1, 2 ]` (two columns, first one splitted in two rows)\n* `layout-nine`: `[ 1, 1, 2 ]` (three columns, last one splitted in two rows)\n* `layout-ten`: `[ 1, 2, 2 ]` (three columns, last two splitted in two rows)\n\n### Give the focus to another pane\n\nUse commands `pane-manager:focus-to-pane-[number]` to change the focus to target pane (`[number]` can be one of the following : `one`, `two`, `three`, `four`, `five`, `six`, `seven`, `eight`, `nine`, `ten`).\n\n### Move a tab to another pane\n\nUse commands `pane-manager:move-to-pane-[number]` to move current tab to target pane (`[number]` can be one of the following : `one`, `two`, `three`, `four`, `five`, `six`, `seven`, `eight`, `nine`, `ten`).\n",
