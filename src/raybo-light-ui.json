  "readme": "# Raybo Light UI theme\n\nWhen I used Sublime Text, I had my own version of the [solarized] theme because I wanted to improve on it's contrast a bit and add some markdown features. I wanted to duplicate that in Atom, so I found a great UI theme from [Pierrezoux] and decided to tweak it from there for my own use.\n\nBased on [Solarized Dark UI] Atom theme. This is a fork of [Pierrezoux]\n\n[Solarized Dark UI]: https://github.com/Rnhmjoj/solarized-dark-ui\n[Pierrezoux]: https://github.com/pierreozoux/solarized-light-ui\n",
