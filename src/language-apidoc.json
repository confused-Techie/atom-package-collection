  "readme": "## apiDoc highlighting for Atom\n\n**Because tree-sitter is still in development, this pacakge will disable JSDoc highlighting in apiDoc comment blocks. If this is causing problems for you, the only solution is to disable tree-sitter in your settings.**\n\n**Also, Python is broken. I really don't understand why. Trying to get this fixed ASAP**\n\nThe official unofficial atom grammar package for [apiDoc](http://apidocjs.com/). Install this and *it just works*. No extra setup neccessary.\n\n* ```apm install language-apidoc```\n\nI found apiDoc and was surprised it didn't have an Atom grammar yet, so I made it.\n\nThis should automatically work with any languages that support block comments for documentation. Since this injects itself into anything that looks like a documentation block comment, it may misbehave with other packages the work inside comment blocks. You can simply disable the package if this becomes a problem.\n\nPlease [open an issue](https://github.com/almic/language-apidoc/issues) if you find a language that isn't getting the right highlighting.\n\nSupported languages:\n* JavaScript\n* CoffeeScript\n* Ruby\n\nOther languages may work as well, but these are guaranteed to work correctly.\n\n## Snippets\nAlso comes with a few snippets to make life easier.\n\n<br>\n\n**`apiDoc`**\n```js\n/**\n * @api {get} /path title\n * @apiVersion 0.0.0\n * @apiName\n * @apiGroup\n */\n```\n\n<br>\n\n**`apiDefine`**\n```js\n/**\n * @apiDefine Name Title\n * Description\n * @apiVersion 0.0.0\n */\n```\n",
