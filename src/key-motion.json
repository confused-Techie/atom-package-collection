  "readme": "## Easily navigate around your editor without using the mouse\n\nAs a GUI application, Atom assumes mouse usage in many places. Some panels, sidebars and controls are impossible to access without pointing and clicking.\n\nA lot of people prefer to not have to move their hands from the keyboard, either for speed and simplicity, or even RSI and accessibility issues.\n\nInspired by a built-in ability of the [Oni](https://onivim.io) neovim GUI application, KeyMotion offers vimium/easymotion-like shortcuts to clickable interface items outside of the editor window. Use the keymotion:nav command to place indicators on everything KeyMotion recognizes as clickable, and then type the two character identifier next to that element to click (or in some cases activate) it.\n\nKeyMotion does not currently default any keybindings to its action(s). Keyboard-navigation enthusiasts often have a lot of keybindings of their own, and I don't want the package to step on those. Feel free to add your own keybindings as are suitable for you.\n\n*This plugin is in very early stages*, and so may not correctly identify or handle all cases. If you encounter something in your editor that KeyMotion does not recognize, but is clickable, please create an issue on the Github repo with the following information..\n\n- the html for the element that needs clicking\n- Where that element comes from, is it native Atom? or a downloaded package? Which package?\n\n### Future features\n- [Easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion) style navigation in the text editor buffer\n  - Linewise up and down\n  - forward and back based on a selected character\n  - throughout the page based on a sequence of 2 characters\n  - word beginnings\n  - word endings\n- Other navigation abilities as suggested by users, or as I think of more..\n\nThe goal is to make Atom as usable as VIM completely with the keyboard.\n",
