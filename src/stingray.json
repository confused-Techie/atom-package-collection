  "readme": "# Atom package for Stingray\n\nThis package provides a number of features that integrates Atom\nwith the Stingray game engine.\n\nThe features that depend on communication with the Stingray engine require\nthe Stingray WebSocket interface, which is currently only available in the\ndevelopment branch of Stingray (which will eventually be released as Stingray\n1.3). That means they won't work with the current binary releases of Stingray.\nFeature compatibility is shown in the list below:\n\n* SJSON syntax highlighting (Stingray 1.1)\n* Stingray Lua API help (Stingray 1.1)\n* Auto-complete for Lua API and resource paths (Stingray 1.1)\n* Navigate between resources (Stingray 1.1)\n* Launch Stingray project and hot reload content (Stingray 1.3)\n* Lua REPL console integrated into Atom (Stingray 1.3)\n\nMost of these features are available through the *Stingray* menu\nadded by the package.\n\n## Features\n\n### SJSON Syntax Highlighting\n\nStingray uses a \"more human readable\" format of JSON called SJSON.\nThe Stingray package provides SJSON syntax highlighting for\nStingray resource files, such as `.level`, `.unit`, etc.\n\nThe syntax package also provides HLSL syntax high lighting for\nresource shaders, using the shader syntax from [sublime-shaders](https://github.com/noct/sublime-shaders).\n\n### Stingray Lua API Help\n\nPress `F1` to bring up the Adoc help for the Stingray Lua API\nfunction located under your cursor.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jims/atom-stingray/master/docs/help-selection.gif)\n\nPress `Shift-F1` to bring up a dialog box that allows you to search among all the help files.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jims/atom-stingray/master/docs/help.gif)\n\n### Auto-complete for Lua API and Stingray resource paths\n\nAs you type Lua API functions and Stingray resource paths, the Stingray\nplugin will offer autocomplete suggestions.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jims/atom-stingray/master/docs/autocomplete.gif)\n\n### Navigate between resources\n\nWith the cursor in a Stingray resource path you can quick-jump to the\nresource.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jims/atom-stingray/master/docs/go-to-resource.gif)\n\n### Launch stingray projects and hot-reload content\n\nYou can launch Stingray projects directly from atom by choosing\n`Run Project`. Atom will locate your current project by reading\nthe settings file in your toolchain folder (located by the `$SR_BIN_DIR`\nvariable).\n\nIf you just want to check that your data compiles without actually\nlaunching the project, you can use the `Compile` menu\noption.\n\nWith the project running there are several ways of hot-reloading\nproject content. `Refresh` tells the engine to reload all changed files.\n\nIf you are just working in Lua, you can use `Execute Buffer` to\nrun the Lua file you are currently editing. This will effective hot-reload\nthat file. You can also use `Execute Selection` to run just the\nLua code that you have currently selected.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jims/atom-stingray/master/docs/refresh.gif)\n\n### Lua REPL console integrated into Atom\n\n`Toggle Console` shows the Lua REPL that allows you to communicate\nwith the running Lua engine. Output from the engine will be printed\nto the console and you can write Lua code directly into the console.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jims/atom-stingray/master/docs/repl.gif)\n\n## Settings\n\nFor the plugin to find your Stingray settings and executables it must be able\nto locate your Stingray installation. There are three ways of doing this:\n\n* If the editor is already running, the plugin will connect to the running\neditor and talk to it to find out the installation directory. (This only works\nin Stingray 1.3.)\n\n* Otherwise, the plugin will look for an Atom setting called `stingray.toolchainPath`\nthat should point to your Stingray toolchain directory. That is the top level\nStingray directory which has subdirectories called `core`, `editor`, `engine`,\netc.\n\n* If that setting has not been set, the plugin will read the installation directory\nfrom the environment variable `SR_BIN_DIR`.\n\nIf neither of these options work, the plugin will not be able to find your\nStingray installation and will run in offline mode.\n",
