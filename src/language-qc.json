  "readme": "# language-qc\nThis package gives QC language support in Atom. (Source Format)\n\n# About\nAtom is my (CosignCosine's) preferred code/text editor and I didn't want to get another editor just for SFM ports, so I coded the language support. It's not that hard; I'm surprised it hasn't been done before.\n\n# To-Do\n\n2. Update Source Developer Wiki to reflect the fact that this has been created.\n4. Profit??\n6. Add installation via APM\n\n# Installation Instructions\n### Method 1: Cloning\n1. CD into `Macintosh HD/Users/<username>/.atom/packages` on Mac or `C:Users\\<username>\\.atom\\packages` on Windows.\n2. Clone the repository. If you don't know how to do this, you probably shouldn't use this method.\n\n### Method 2: Atom\n1. If Atom isn't installed, why are you here? (Install Atom.)\n2. Go to `Packages > Settings View > Install Packages/Themes`\n3. Install package `language-qc`.\n4. If it doesn't work, restart Atom.\n\n### Method 3: I'm from 1880 What Is This\n1. Copy each script line-by-line onto a piece of paper by candlelight (modern lighting does not work for this).\n2. Create a computer. This is by far the most difficult part of installing this script, as there is no clear way to do it as PCPartPicker hasn't been invented yet. Make sure that the computer can create a .PDF file.\n3. Buy a camera. This may be difficult depending on where you live.\n4. Take a picture of your paper (remember to light your scene correctly).\n5. Create a coding language. I'd recommend recreating Java as there must be a better way to implement it than what it currently is.\n6. Code (from scratch) a picture-to-text interpreter using your coding language.\n7. Use the picture-to-text interpreter.\n8. You must now create a time machine. Once you create another computer, you should be able to do something. Idk. Or you can just wait a hundred years or so until Atom is invented.\n9. You also have to wait until Quake C is invented.\n10. Copy and paste the text from the picture-to-text into a new file in Atom. Make sure it will still run on your computer and that your computer is still in good order.\n11. Save it to wherever the heck atom packages are stored on your computer.\n12. Realize that you've wasted over 100 years of your life working on a less-than-100-line-script's compatibility with something that you don't own.\n\n# Notes\n1. I'm not connected to internet as I write this README. That may explain the lengthy third method.\n",
