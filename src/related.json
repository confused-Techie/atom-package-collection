  "readme": "# Related for Atom\nRelated is a port of the [sublime-related-files](https://github.com/fabiokr/sublime-related-files) plugin for Atom.\n\nRelated provides a quick way to access files that are \"related\" to the file currently opened. For example, Related includes\na set of patterns for switching between C/C++/Objective-C source and header files.\n\n![Related in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nick125/related/master/related.gif)\n\n## What is a \"related\" file?\nThe relationship between files is defined through a set of **patterns**. For example,\n```cson\n\"lib/(.+).coffee\": [\n  \"spec/$1-spec.coffee\"\n]\n```\nprovides a mapping from a CoffeeScript file (through a **matcher**) in lib/ to a unit test in spec/ (through a **result**)\n-- that is, if I currently have the file lib/foo.coffee open and the file spec/foo-spec.coffee exists, Related\nwill show it as a file to jump to. Each pattern can have multiple results, and a single file\ncan match multiple patterns.\n\n### Creating files\nRelated allows you to optionally create related files by specifying the 'create' flag at the end of your result. For example,\nwith the currently open file \"lib/foo.coffee\",\n```cson\n\"lib/(.+).coffee\": [\n  \"spec/$1-spec.coffee#create\"\n]\n```\nwould prompt you to create \"spec/foo-spec.coffee\" if it doesn't already exist.\n\n## Keymapping\nBy default, Related uses ctrl+shift+r.\n\n## Configuration\nRelated includes a limited default pattern set, but there are some additional examples in the examples/ directory. To add a pattern,\nsee the \"Edit related patterns\" options under the Packages -> Related menu.\n\nRelated provides the following configuration options:\n * openSingleItemAutomatically - If only a single existing file matches the pattern, automatically open it instead of prompting\n * onlyShowCreateIfNoResults - Only offer to create files if there are no other existing results.\n",
