  "readme": "# RGBASM language support in Atom\n\nAdds syntax highlighting to RGBASM assembly files in [Atom](https://atom.io).\n\n## RGBASM\n\nRGBASM is the assembler dialect used for programming Game Boy games with the [Rednex Game Boy Development System](https://rednex.github.io) (RGBDS).\n\nThis is sometimes erroneously referred to as \"Z80 assembler\"; although the Game Boy's CPU is similar to Z80 and 8080, it's distinct, and using Z80 syntax highlighting isn't ideal, especially when using RGBASM features.\n\n### Language reference\n\n* [RGBASM language documentation](https://rednex.github.io/rgbds/rgbasm.5.html)\n* [RGBASM Game Boy CPU opcode reference](https://rednex.github.io/rgbds/gbz80.7.html)\n\n## To do\n\nSee [issues](https://github.com/tobiasvl/language-rgbasm/issues) for known bugs and planned features.\n\nPlease open an issue to report something. Pull requests are more than welcome.\n\n## Related grammars\n\nThis grammar was inspired by other related grammars, but focuses on coverage of RGBASM, including features from newer versions of RGBDS.\n\n* https://github.com/Bananattack/rgbds_textmate – RGBASM grammar for TextMate\n* https://github.com/DonaldHays/rgbds-vscode/blob/master/syntaxes/rgbds-asm.tmLanguage - RGBASM grammar for VSCode\n* https://atom.io/packages/language-gb – TASM grammar for Atom\n* https://atom.io/packages/language-z80asm – generic Z80 grammar for Atom\n",
