Customized syntax highlighting for inline style and class attributes, image tags, anchors tags, href and src attributes. Is meant as a replacement for the standard HTML grammar.\n\nThe odd img and anchor tag colorings can be commented out/removed in the less file. They're colored this way as a lot of our editing is based solely around these tags, so they stand out a bit more.\n\nModeled after [language-html](https://github.com/atom/language-html). I also disable the core package language-hyperlink.\n\n![lpc-language-pack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BRiL1201/lpc-language-pack/master/screenshots/Screenshot1.PNG)\n![lpc-language-pack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BRiL1201/lpc-language-pack/master/screenshots/Screenshot2.PNG)\n",
