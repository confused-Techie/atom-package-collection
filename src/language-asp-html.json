  "readme": "# ASP inside HTML (.ascx & .aspx) language support in Atom\n\nAdds syntax highlighting to ASP files in Atom.\n\nOriginally forked from the [PHP Atom package](https://github.com/atom/language-php).\n\n> Thank you to all who have downloaded and found this package useful. It was made because of my own frustrations working on a bunch of legacy code, and a year later it's been downloaded over 1,500 times.\n\nContributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a\npull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.\n\n--------------\n\nI just pulled this from PHP because the php highlighting worked well with `if` statements using curly braces, whereas the ASP languages I have looked into [don't tend to do that well](https://github.com/jbalboni/atom-language-aspx/issues/5).\n\nI know NOTHING about language packages going into this, so you might find some strange leftovers from PHP in here...\n\nAs of now, it does the proper highlighting where `<% if (bool) { %> HTML <% } %>` is concerned. So that is a win.\n\n--------------\n\n# Change Log\n## 0.3.0\n* Supports comment tags. `<%-- COMMENT HERE --%>`. Works over multiple lines. It does still highlight certain bits of code inside comments, but it is still pretty readable. Again, I am claiming ignorance.\n* Don't worry. It's still got tons of useless PHP holdovers included. And zero applicable tests. Woot!\n\n## 0.2.0\n* Supports `if` blocks properly. Or at least mostly.",
