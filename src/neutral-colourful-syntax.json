  "readme": "# Neutral-colourful theme\n\nBsed on the Monokai pallete, but with the idea of keeping a neutral overall colour. I use Atom for a lot of graphics related work, and after trying to find themes without overall colour biases I gave up and decided to make my own. I still like a reasonably colourful syntax theme, because I suck at coding, and it helps me to see lots of colourful syntax highlighting.\n",
