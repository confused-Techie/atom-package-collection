  "readme": "# hydrogen-cell-separator\n\n## Description\nAtom plugin that separates [Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen) breakpoints (cells designated with # %%) with a horizontal line improving cell identification.\n\n![hydrogen-cell-separator](hydrogen-cell.png)\n\n## Usage\nEnabling / Disabling package.\n\n## Acknowledgement\nThis package was mainly inspired by\n[method-separator](https://atom.io/packages/method-separator)\ndeveloped by Koen Lageveen.\n\n## Troubleshoot\n\n### Issue 1: Breakpoints are not recognised\nCurrently, Atom is using [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) (an incremental parsing system for programming tools) which creates a conflict detecting hydrogen breakpoints. As suggested in https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/1602#issuecomment-490512892, the easiest workaround is to disable tree-sitter in Settings >> Core.\n",
