What is, this repository? Well, let's break it down.\n\nWhat is Ti-Basic? Ti-Basic is the language found on Ti-84 calculators, probably. I use it a lot.\n\nWhat's a language? Idk.\n\nWhat's this for? [Atom](http://atom.io)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis is more of a \"How do languages in Atom work?\" and I'm really just trying my best here. PRs are welcome.\n\nSomething not working? Feel free to report it as an [issue](http://github.com/Chew/language-TiBasic/issues).\n",
