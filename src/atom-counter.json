  "readme": "AtomCounter\n===========\n\nA counter for the joke created by AlynxZhou.\n\n## The Joke\n\n- Chinese Version\n\n\t我看到 Hackghost 的桌面上有一个计数器，上面显示数字“233”，于是我好奇地去问他这个计数器代表什么意思。他回答说：“这个数字代表了我今天被蠢货们打断了工作的次数”。说完他又按了一下计数器按钮，于是现在数字变为“234”了。\n\n- English Version Translated by AlynxZhou\n\n\tI saw a counter on Hackghost's desktop showing a number \"233\", and I asked him what it means curiously. He said \"That represents how many times I was interrupted by idiots today\". After speaking he pressed the button of counter again, and then the number became \"234\".\n\n## Usage\n\nClick the counter on the status bar to add 1 and count **WHAT THE FUCK** you want to count, including your coding hours, your drinking times, your fucking fucking times, your fucking fucking this counter times, etc.\n\nIt's a meta-counter that can count every thing you did with/without Atom, a hackable text editor for the 21st centery, with a fuckable counter.\n\n![They say I need an image for my package.](./usage.png)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
