  "readme": "# Atom Cucumber Runner Package\n\n----\n\nTotal rip-off of the atom-rspec package, but runs cucumber instead. I should\nrefactor the common bits out, but for now I just wanted something working. I'm\nlazy like that, which isn't really the good kind of lazy. *Sigh*\n\n-----\n\nAdd ability to run Cucumber and see the output without leaving Atom.\n\nHotKeys:\n\n- __alt+cmd+k__ - executes current feature file\n- __ctrl+cmd+__ - executes only the cuke on the line the cursor's at\n- __ctrl+alt+k__ - re-executes the last executed cuke\n",
