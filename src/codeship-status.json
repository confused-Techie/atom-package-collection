  "readme": "# Codeship.io Status Package\n\nAdd the [Codeship.io](http://www.codeship.io) status of the project to the Atom status bar.\n\n## Installing\n\nUse the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or run\n`apm install codeship-status` from the command line.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Codeship status for the repository is displayed via the clock-arrow icon\nin the Atom status bar. The icon will be orange when Codeship is currently\nbuilding your project, green if the build was successfull and red if the build\nfailed.\n\nThe build status is updated when the project is first opened in Atom and from\nthen on whenever the \"status\" of the project repository changes. The handling of\nthese events was borrowed from the `git-view.coffee` part of the `status-bar`\npackage.\n\n### Configuration\n\nTo be able to figure out the build status of the project, you have to create a\n_.codeship.yml_ file in your project directory containing the UUID of the\nCodeship project.\n\n```yaml\n# Sample .codeship.yml file\n# (This is not a real UUID ;) )\nuuid: abcdefgh-1234-ijkl-5678-mnopqrstuvwx\n```\n\n(You can find out the UUID of your project by going to the the _General_ tab of\nyour project settings.)\n\n### Commands\n\nThe following commands are available for users to keymap.\n\n* `codeship-status:toggle` - Toggle the status bar entry\n\n## Coming Soon\n\n* Open the project on Codeship.io\n* Better support for multiple branches\n\nFeel free to open an issue to discuss potential features to add or improve.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project is inspired and heavily based on the\n[Travis CI Status Package](https://atom.io/packages/travis-ci-status) by\n[tombell](https://atom.io/users/tombell).\n",
