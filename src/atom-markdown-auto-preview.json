  "readme": "# Atom Markdown Auto-Preview\n\n## Blurb\n\nAutomatically activates the preview tab corresponding to a Markdown source file (if open in a different pane).\nWorks a treat with `markdown-scroll-sync`!\n\n![Screencap in action](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10861177/20911665/ad3c5d84-bbbd-11e6-97c5-6a0270c310ef.gif)\n\n## Features\n\n* When switching to a Markdown file, makes the first corresponding preview active (visible)\n  * If it has already been opened\n  * Is in a different pane/group to the source file\n\n* When closing a Markdown file, closes any corresponding previews\n\n## Fiddly bits\n\nThe module works on the following logic:\n  * If the previewer exists, and\n  * If the previewer is in a different pane, then\n  * Make the previewer visible\n\nThe module scans all open tabs for ones which have an 'editor' property, to identify preview-type tabs\n\nThe 'editor' property must match the editor which has just been made active:\n  * Sometimes this fails after reloading a window or in similar circumstances\n  * The preview tabs persist, but this link back to the source editor is no longer valid (a limitation of Atom)\n",
