  "readme": "# i4atom package\n\nSupport developer workflow and integration among [Trello](https://trello.com/),\n[Github](https://github.com/) and [Slack](https://slack.com/)\n\nThis package will save you a lot of work if you use Trello cards for a scrum-like\nwork organization of tasks, but implement the features using Github pull requests and\ncommunicate over Slack\n\n![i4atom screenshot](i4atom.png \"i4atom screenshot\")\n\n\n* It shows all your work in progress cards, along all your boards\n* It creates pull requests in one click: pushes current branch, creates the pull\n  request in Github including a link to the Trello card, and adds a comment in the\n  Trello card with a link to the pull request. Documentation tasks made easy!\n* It shows a list of all the pull requests in every card with the following information:\n  - Pull request revision status with link to the pull request\n  - Continuous integration status with a link to the continuous integration url\n  - Changelog entry status with a link to the `CHANGELOG.md` file\n  - Button for checking out the pull request branch (easy change between cards)\n  - Button for asking pull request review in Slack\n* Besides the open pull request button, there are buttons for adding time information\n  to the card (for time tracking), and a button for moving the card to the testing\n  list\n\n## Installation\n\n```\napm install git@github.com:i4a/i4atom\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou must provide [i4atom](https://github.com/i4a/i4atom) with a Trello key and token, and a Slack webhook.\nBesides, you need to activate the Github tab.\n\nThe package will lead you to setting them from its configuration section.\n\n## Trello conventions\n\n### List names\n\n[i4atom](https://github.com/i4a/i4atom) will look for a list in each board with the name `✏️ In Progress`. The `Done` button moves cards to a list with the name `🐛 Testing`\n\n\n### Pull request and time detection\n\n[i4atom](https://github.com/i4a/i4atom) looks for strings in the form of `PR: <url>` or `Time: <time>` in the comments of each Trello card.\n\n## Development\n\nYou can make atom use a local copy of the repository with\n\n1. Remove `i4atom` if it is already installed\n\n```\napm rm i4atom\n```\n\n2. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/i4a/i4atom)\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:i4a/i4atom.git\n```\n\n3. Go to your local atom packages folder\n\n```\ncd ~/.atom/packages\n```\n\n4. Link the package\n\n```\nln -s <path/to/cloned/i4atom>\n```\n\n5. Restart atom\n\n### JSHint\n\nInstall the [JSHint](https://atom.io/packages/jshint) package for linting support\n\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis package has been developed by [ideas4all Innovation](https://www.ideas4allinnovation.com/), in the investment time for personal side projects.\n\n[![ideas4all Innovation](ideas4allinnovation.png \"ideas4all Innovation\")](https://www.ideas4allinnovation.com/)\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2020 Global ideas4all SL\n",
