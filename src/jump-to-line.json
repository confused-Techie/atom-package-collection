  "readme": "# jump-to-line\n\nRapidly jump to the start of any line that is currently visible.\n\n![gif](https://cldup.com/wK4OJ-4eHF.gif)\n\nThis was the only feature that I really used from [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion), and no other\npackage emulated the workflow that I wanted well. Most of the time I don't want\nto search, or figure out what motion gets me precisely where I want. With this\nI just look at the line that I want to jump to, hit the label button, and I'm\nthere.\n\n# Features\n\n* Search and jump to position across visible panes.\n* [easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion) style label jump.\n\n# How to use\n\n1. Start jump-to-line-mode with `jump-to-line:start`\n2. Type the label for the line you want to go to, and your cursor will be moved\n\n# Commands\n\n* `jump-to-line:start`: Start smalls jumping mode.\n\n# Keymap\nNo keymap by default.\n\ne.g.\n\n```coffeescript\n'atom-text-editor:not([mini])':\n  'ctrl-;': 'jump-to-line:start'\n```\n\n# Similar packages\n\nAtom\n* [atom-smalls](https://atom.io/packages/smalls)\n* [jumpy](https://atom.io/packages/jumpy)\n* [easy-motion](https://github.com/adrian-budau/easy-motion)\n* [quick-jump](https://atom.io/packages/quick-jump)\n* [QuickJumpPlus](https://atom.io/packages/QuickJumpPlus)\n\nVim\n* [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion)\n* [clever-f](https://github.com/rhysd/clever-f.vim)\n* [vim-sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak)\n* [vim-seek](https://github.com/goldfeld/vim-seek)\n* [vim-smalls](https://github.com/t9md/vim-smalls)\n\nEmacs\n* [ace-jump-mode](https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode)\n\nIntelliJ\n* [AceJump](https://github.com/johnlindquist/AceJump)\n\n# Thanks to great predecessor!!\n\nThis package is a fork and rewrite to flow/ES6 of [atom-smalls](https://atom.io/packages/smalls)\n",
