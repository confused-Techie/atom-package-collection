  "readme": "# Atom syntax highlighting for Commodore BASIC 2.0\n\nColorful BASIC code for the Atom editor. Visit the homepage for the [language-cbmbasic package](https://atom.io/packages/language-cbmbasic) here, or download from directly within Atom and get started on your next text adventure game within minutes.\n\nIsn't it about time we had modern language support for the classic programming language of the Commodore 64? Obviously, the lack of this feature in most text editors today has been the principal obstacle to Gen-X programmers revisiting their roots. You are now one step further along on your inevitable journey back to where it all began:\n\n`10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10`\n\nI made this syntax highlighter package while working on an implementation of [mal LISP](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) in C-64 BASIC using the [cbmbasic](https://github.com/mist64/cbmbasic) interpreter. I got tired of the sterility of plain text. I don't know how I ever tolerated programming this way on a low resolution TV screen. I formally withdraw all my subsequent complaints about anything whatsoever.\n\nContributions welcome if you seriously think this is worth extending any further!\n\n### License (ISC)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016, Steven J.
