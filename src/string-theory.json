  "readme": "# String-theory\n\nString theory is an Atom UI theme based on `Nucleus-Dark`. Similarly to Nucleus,\nit bases most of the coloring on the syntax theme you use within Atom, and works\nbest with a dark syntax theme. My personal recommendations for syntax themes are\n`seti` or `Base16 Tomorrow Dark`.\n\n![String-theory](http://fred.d.pr/19qGh.png)\n\n\n## Why ST versus Nucleus?\n\nNucleus, while a great theme, is quite opinionated. As such, I felt more at ease\nforking rather than submitting a pull request. String-theory includes changes to\nseveral sections of the Atom UI, including a slightly cleaner status bar,\ntighter font and tab sizing, as well as some better control over gutter display.\n\n\n## Installing\n\nInstalling String-theory is as simple as installing another atom package. You\ncan either find it via the settings page, or by using `apm`:\n\n```apm install string-theory```\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to submit pull requests to further string-theory development. Thanks\nin advance for your help.\n",
