  "readme": "# Scaffolding\n\nScaffolding is a package used to create a project folder and file hierarchy with the click of a button.\n\n![Scaffolding](/preview/preview.png)\n\nAdded a separate file hierarchy system for splitting the main file up into smaller files for better management.\n\n__I still need to actually develop some unit testing__\n\n## Structure\n\nEdit the scaffolding.cson file to include your folder file hierarchy:\n\nYou can edit this by using the command:\n```\n\"ctrl-alt-o\": \"scaffolding:edit\"\n```\n\nor by clicking the edit button in the scaffolding panel.\n\nWhen you click on your scaffolding name in the list the hierarchy is built in the current project root directory.\n\n```CSON\n[\n  {\n    name: \"Scaffolding\"\n    root: [\n      {\n        type: \"dir\"\n        name: \"folder\"\n        root: [\n          {\n            type: \"file\"\n            name: \"file.txt\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n      {\n        type: \"dir\"\n        name: \"empty\"\n      }\n      {\n        type: \"file\"\n        name: \"file_with_stuff.txt\"\n        contents: \"stuff\"\n      }\n      {\n        type: \"file\"\n        name: \"file_with_multi-line_stuff.txt\"\n        contents: '''\n          stuff\n          more stuff\n        '''\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  {\n    name: \"item 2\"\n    rootUrl: './file.txt'\n    ...\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Separate file structure\n\nYou can setup an external root file using the `rootUrl` option instead of using `root`, this is a relative path to the file from the default scaffolding.cson file. This is designed to store the other files in the same directory as the main scaffolding file.\n\nYou can optionally link a plain text hierarchy file `.txt`, `.cson`, or `.json` file\n\n### CSON\n\n```CSON\n{\n    name: \"name\"\n    root: [\n        {\n            name: \"name\"\n            type: \"file|dir\"\n            root: [\n\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### JSON\n\n```JSON\n{\n    \"name\": \"name\",\n    \"root\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"name\",\n            \"type\": \"file|dir\",\n            \"root\": [\n\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Plain text\n\n```\n#Name\nfolder/\n    file.txt\n        content\n        content\n            indented content\n    folder2/\n```\n\nThe first line is optionally the name of the hierarchy denoted by starting the line with `#`.\n\nFolders require a `/` at the end of the line to denote a folder.\n\nThe structure is indent sensitive. The file needs to be indented by 4 spaces ` ` ` ` ` ` ` `, or a tab `\\t`. Indenting inside a file, such as the example `file.txt` is ignored past the first indent and will show up in the contents of the file:\n\nfile.txt:\n\n```\ncontent\ncontent\n    indented content\n```\n\n## keymapping\n\nThis package uses the default keymapping from package generation:\n\nToggle scaffolding panel:\n\n```\n\"ctrl-alt-o\": \"scaffolding:toggle\"\n```\n",
