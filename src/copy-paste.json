  "readme": "# copy-paste package\n\nRecord screencasts like a pro with this copy paste package for Atom. Simply copy the code and it will be inserted character by character into the Atom editor with random delay.\n\n![A screenshot of your package](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5931248/16114224/17c19b08-33b8-11e6-8144-d9031d8cc558.gif)\n\nThis package was developed as a tool to aid in learning by showing code as it if it typed, like for example for use in College/University classrooms.\n\nThe default behavior is as follows:\n\n  1. Copy or Cut some text from inside the editor\n  2. Either press the key-binding (default Alt-Ctrl-V on Windows) or Activate from the Menu Bar (Packages>Copy Paste>Auto Paste)\n  3. Let it fly, the package will Paste character by character with a random delay, don't move the cursor or type with keyboard.\n  4. Either wait for it to finish OR stop it with the key-binding (default Esc key on Windows) or from the Menu Bar (Packages>Copy Paste>Stop)\n\nSpeed of delay can be edited from the settings files.\n\nThe gif was made using the [Screen-Recorder](https://github.com/lexcast/screen-recorder) package \n",
