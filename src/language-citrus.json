  "readme": "# language-citrus\n\n[Citrus](https://github.com/mjackson/citrus) is a great ruby peg parsing library,\ncreated by [Michael Jackson](https://github.com/mjackson/citrus)\n\nPeg parsing (otherwise known as understandable parsing, or parsing for humans) is how an\nuninitiated would go about parsing. Packrat or recursive descent are other names.\n\nWhile recursive descent is proven not to be very fast, it is nevertheless used by such prominent\nprojects as llvm (to parse c and c++), because it makes it possible to understand, and thus\ndebug and maintain a parser with relative ease.\n\nCitrus's uniqueness is in the way it combines the power of ruby to generate code at runtime\nwith the ease of peg parsing. The grammar (to build grammars) is not unlike ruby itself and easily\nunderstood.\n\nThanks to the atom folks for writing the converter :-)\n",
