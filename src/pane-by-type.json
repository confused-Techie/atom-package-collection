  "readme": "# Pane By Type\n\nOpen new files in a pane that contains the same type of file.\n\nIt works by looking at each pane and the items it has, and if it has an item\nwith the same extension it will open the file in that pane.\n\n## TODO\nThings that will or could perhaps be done\n- [ ] Add pane layouts with predefined types?\n- [ ] Base types on more than file extension?\n",
