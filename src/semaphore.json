  "readme": "# Semaphore\n\nShows the [Semaphore](http://semaphoreapp.com) build status for the current project in the Atom status bar.\n\n![Semaphore Preview](http://i.imgur.com/w3OqO96.png)\n\n## Configuring\n\nFind your authentication token for your Semaphore project.\n\nThis can be found by pressing \"settings\" in the project, and then choosing API.\n\n## How was this built?\n\nI \"stole\" everything from [Cliff Rowley](https://github.com/cliffrowley) who did the [Circle CI package](https://github.com/cliffrowley/atom-circle-ci) for Atom.\n\nAll credits goes to Cliff.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis is by no means perfect.\nPlease consider contributing if you believe you have ideas on how to make it better.\n\nThis Semaphore package has much the same limitations as Cliffs Circle CI package.\n\nHowever, the following actually works with Semaphore\n\n### Multiple projects\n\nYou are only able to input one authentication token.\nThis authentication token binds to your Semaphore account so you should be able to track multiple projects.\nThe package will look up the status of the build based on the Github repository (`username/project`) as well as the current branch name.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIssues, sugestions and pull requests are more than welcome.\n\n## TODO\n\nWrite specs.\n",
