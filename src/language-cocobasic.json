  "readme": "# Atom syntax highlighting for TRS-80 Extended Color Basic 2.1\n\nBased on Steven J. Syrek Atom BASIC syntax highlighting for the Commodore 64, this version is customized to be used with Extended Color BASIC for the TRS-80 Color Computer.\n\nThis syntax highlighter supports the BASIC available in the Color Computer 3 (which includes commands like HCOLOR, HPAINT, etc...). It should work just fine with CoCo 1 and Coco 2 BASIC as well.\n\nContributions welcome if you seriously think this is worth extending any further!\n\n### License (ISC)\n\nCopyright (c) 2017, Paulo Garcia <pedgarcia@gmail.com>\n\nBased on Steven J.
