  "readme": "camel-select\n============\n\nA smarter selection for camelCase and snake_case.  \n\n> **Disclaimer:** This is not an official Google product.\n\nThis Atom plugin changes the behavior of cursor movement when pressing the\nCtrl/Cmd keys to a way that is friendlier on souce code that contains snake_case\nand camelCase by mimicking Eclipse's *Smart Caret* instead of Atom's\n\"subword-boundary\" behavior.\n\nThis simple and seemingly small difference makes a big impact while coding,\nespecially for someone who works a lot with Eclipse due to muscle memory.\nNow switching between both editors feels like working on the same one.  \nAn analogy: Vim users want Vim bindings on Atom.\n\n![Comparison of Atom's native behavior vs this plugin.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2022649/26031913/6bf87350-3839-11e7-9a9f-e92d9c36d810.png)\n\nMovement is determined by categorizing characters in 5 groups, and instead of\nstopping at non-word characters, the cursor stops when there is a transition:\n\n*   Lower case characters.\n*   Upper case characters.\n*   Boundary characters. From your config in `Settings -> Editor -> Non Word\n    Characters`, plus `_`.\n*   Space characters. (Those that match `\\s`)\n*   Neutral characters, the rest of them.\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0; see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.\n",
