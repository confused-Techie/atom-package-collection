This is the feature for you. Codealike shows you your \"Focus Curve\" but it also shows you how many interruptions you had during different periods of time. This is handy to show clearly how much effort it takes to recover from undesired interruptions.\n\n#### [![](https://blog.codealike.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/focus.gif)](http://www.codealike.com)\n\n\n\n#### Timeline\n\nThis feature shows you the ADN of your work. It rebuilds your day by showing you the precise sequence of activity that you did so you can drilldown and explore every segment of time to understand what you did.\n\n[![](https://blog.codealike.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/timeline.gif)](http://www.codealike.com)\n\n\n#### Code Tree\n\nShows you the amount of time you spend Editing, Reading, Debugging and Building on different code solutions and projects. But why should we stop there? You'll be able to drilldown all the way through Namespaces, Files, Classes, Methods and Members. Use this report to see code's contributors and technical debt.\n\n\n[![](https://blog.codealike.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tree.gif)](http://www.codealike.com)\n\n[![](https://blog.codealike.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tree-files.gif)](http://www.codealike.com)\n\n\n#### Code report\n\nIt helps you understand how much time you spend using different technologies. Have you ever wondered what are the 5 files that your attention the most? Well, wonder no more...\n\n[![](https://blog.codealike.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tech.gif)](http://www.codealike.com)\n\n_Powerful Metrics for High Performance Software Developers._\n\n[SIGN UP TO BEGIN](https://codealike.com/Account/Register) | [www.codealike.com](http://www.codealike.com) |\n",
