  "readme": "# Eiffelicious\n\n### C# syntax theme for Atom 1.24.1\n\nIf you:\n\n- Code in C#\n- Fancy having method and property declarations stand out\n- Are okay with using an older version of Atom\n- Don't require Visual Studio for getting work done, and\n- Don't mind wearing sunglasses\n\nThis theme might spice up your life.\n\nInspired from [TextMate](https://macromates.com/)'s [_Eiffel_ theme](https://inkdeep.github.io/TextMate-Themes/#eiffel), **_Eiffelicious_** works well with C# and [Atom 1.24.1](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.24.1).\n\n![Eiffelicious preview screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/dMO1wFo.png)\n\n#### Why Atom 1.24.1?\n\nAtom's ability to change font sizes for specific symbols is something unique compared to other editors.\n\nUnfortunately, newer versions of Atom suffer from a regression of being incapable of detecting the difference between declarations and calls for methods and properties in C#, so all symbols of a method or property are affected by styling changes, regardless of context. 1.24.1 seems to be the last version that knows the difference.\n\nDespite being an older version, Atom's generic multi-file intellisense autocompletion still works well without needing to rely on external code parsers.\n\n#### Why _Atom_?\n\nAtom's out-of-the-box search features just work, time and time again.\n\n- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>: Jump to any declaration in the current file.\n\n- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>: Jump to any file in any Project Folder you've added to Atom's sidebar.\n\n- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>: Search all files in your Project Folders for any text.\n\nIn a perfect world, everything would work without a hitch, but the lay of the land is:\n\n- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is slow to launch, takes ages to update, is only for Windows (the macOS version is a different beast), and doesn't play nicely with Unity's project solutions. Too often, projects becomes unlinked, or Visual Studio's intellisense stops working after a DLL is changed, requiring you to reload all the files, and even then it doesn't always come back.\n\n- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can't tell the difference between method and property declarations and calls for C#, and thus can't style them differently.\n\n- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) does not detect C# property declarations when searching via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>, and does not support generic multi-file intellisense.\n\n- [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/) doesn't always work.\n\n- [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) is expensive.\n\nAs silly as it sounds, this particular version of Atom is my preferred C# editor, coupled with this theme.\n\n#### Unity integration\n\nIf you develop games with [Unity](https://unity.com/), go Edit > Preferences > External Tools, and then:\n1. For _External Script Editor_, browse for Atom.exe or Atom.app.\n2. For _External Script Editor Args_, enter: `\"$(File)\":$(Line)`\n\n![Unity preferences for Atom](https://i.imgur.com/b5Fto0F.png)\n\n#### Issues and gotchas with Atom 1.24.1\n\n- Before installing [Atom 1.24.1](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.24.1):\n  1. Disconnect your Internet connection so Atom doesn't update itself.\n  2. Upon launch, go Help > About Atom, and uncheck _Automatically download updates_.\n\n\n- Lines sometimes squish together. Restarting Atom sometimes helps, but you might need to pad your code with a couple blank newlines in places to make things readable.\n\n- After closing a tab or file, Atom may stop suggesting autocomplete results and stop highlighting matching brackets. This can be resolved by reloading Atom via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd>.\n\n#### Recommended complementing packages\n- [animated-page-scroll](https://atom.io/packages/animated-page-scroll)\n- [atom-no-tab-close-icon](https://atom.io/packages/atom-no-tab-close-icon)\n- [change-tabs](https://atom.io/packages/change-tabs)\n- [fancy-bracket-matcher](https://atom.io/packages/fancy-bracket-matcher)\n- [highlight-selected](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected)\n- [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)\n- [multiline-tab](https://atom.io/packages/multiline-tab)\n- [open-files](https://atom.io/packages/open-files)\n- [pinned-tabs](https://atom.io/packages/pinned-tabs)\n- [sublime-block-comment](https://atom.io/packages/sublime-block-comment)\n- [tab-title](https://atom.io/packages/tab-title)\n- [title-bar-replacer](https://atom.io/packages/title-bar-replacer)\n",
