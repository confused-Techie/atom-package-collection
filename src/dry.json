Just write you codes in any of the supported frameworks /languages and watch dry do it job by suggesting snippets to you.\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n* In software engineering, Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development, aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds, especially useful in multi-tier architectures.\r\n\r\n* Using #DRY shouldn't be a problem, since you don't have to type out the complete prefix before choosing a snippet. If there is a better way to avoid prefix conflicts, please let me know in my [github issue](https://github.com/dayogreats/dry/issues/new).\r\n\r\n\r\n* Contributions are always appreciated. Please fork this repo, make changes or additions, and send a pull request.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n#FEATURES\r\n+ Full react, emberjs, grunt, gulpjs, expressjs 4.x api documentation\r\n+ LeftLabel color added to the prefix(es)\r\n+ Express version indicated to show current support version\r\n+ Footer comments added\r\n+ Documentation Read more online link\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n1.
