  "readme": "# extract-component package\n\nRefactoring task to extract a portion of JSX as a new component.\n\n# TODO\n\nx Prettier indentation on both removed and inserted text\n/ Look for var refs and transform to props\n\t- done-ish, currently looks only for MemberExpression names\n\t  would be _better_ if <Image src={images.imageSrc}/> became:\n\t\t  <Component src={images.imageSrc}/>\n\n\t\t\tconst Component = ({ src }) => (\n  \t\t\t<Image src={src}/>\n\t\t  )\n\n\t\talthough this would introduce complexity and probably new edge cases\n- grab jsx component imports\n- restore focus to active editor on modal close\n\t- this should be working, not sure why it isn't\n- save the new component file immediately?\n- add new import last?\n- Allow for leaving children in place, only extracting wrapping element as component\n- Leave children by default, by UI option, or by separate command?\n",
