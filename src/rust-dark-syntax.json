  "readme": "# rust-dark-syntax theme\n\nThis theme is built by combining the blue-greens of mountains viewed from afar with the warm brown-reds of rusted out warehouses or sturdy brick buildings.\nThis theme builds on the cornerstones of Evergreen and Rust, to create a warm palette inspired by post-industrial cities now overgrown by nature (like Chattanooga, Tennessee).\n",
