  "readme": "# Magical Selection\n\nTurns the background of selected text into an animated, constantly shifting rainbow. Concatenate text selection like a sourceror! Other atom text selection plugins don't feature both animation and gradients. Other plugins also don't call on arcane powers beyond the mortal plane.\n\nPreviously known as \"Rainbow Selection Flux\", this plugin mashes up LESS styles by [@mhulse]\n(https://github.com/mhulse \"@mhulse\")\n and [@dmnd](https://github.com/dmnd), combining their interpretations of the \"rainbow selection\" concept into an effect that's totally unnecessary but utterly mystical.\n \n![Rainbow Selection Flux screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563233/17866287/d380b816-685a-11e6-8982-27b619ce1ff0.gif)\n",
