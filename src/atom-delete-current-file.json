  "readme": "# atom-delete-current-file\n\natom-delete-current-file is an Atom package that adds a command for deleting\nthe current file being edited.\n\nOr you could use the \"Tree View: Remove\" command. It does the exact same thing,\nit's just unfortunately named so that I didn't see it until after publishing it.\n\nSo I guess this is just an example of a simple atom package now. Yay!\n\n## Usage\n\nThe `delete-current-file:delete` command will prompt you to confirm that you\nwant to delete the current file, and then delete it. You can bind it to whatever\nkey you wish in your keymap:\n\n```cson\n'atom-workspace':\n  'ctrl-shift-d': 'delete-current-file:delete'\n```\n\nThere is no key binding by default to avoid accidental deletes. There is also a\nmenu item (under Packages -> Delete Current File -> Delete) that activates the\ncommand.\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the MIT License. See `LICENSE` for details.\n",
