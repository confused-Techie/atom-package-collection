  "readme": "# Fuzzy Finder Buffers package\n\n*This is a fork of the great [fuzzy-finder](https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder) package*\n\nThe difference is that in the buffer list, you can close the buffers by hitting `ctrl-k` or remapping to `fuzzy-finder:close-buffer`\n\n---\n\nQuickly find and open files using <kbd>cmd-t</kbd>.\n\n  * <kbd>cmd-t</kbd> or <kbd>cmd-p</kbd> to open the file finder\n  * <kbd>cmd-b</kbd> to open the list of open buffers\n  * <kbd>cmd-shift-b</kbd> to open the list of Git modified and untracked files\n  * <kbd>enter</kbd> defaults to opening the selected file without leaving the current pane\n  * <kbd>shift-enter</kbd> defaults to switching to another pane if the file is already open there\n  * <kbd>cmd-k</kbd> <kbd>right</kbd> (or any other directional arrow) will open the highlighted file in a new pane on the side indicated by the arrow\n\nTurning on the \"Search All Panes\" setting reverses the behavior of <kbd>enter</kbd> and <kbd>shift-enter</kbd> so <kbd>enter</kbd> opens the file in any pane and <kbd>shift-enter</kbd> creates a new tab in the current pane.\n\nThis package uses both the `core.ignoredNames` and `fuzzy-finder.ignoredNames` config settings to filter out files and folders that will not be shown. Both of those config settings are interpreted as arrays of [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) glob patterns.\n\nThis package also will also not show Git ignored files when the `core.excludeVcsIgnoredPaths` is enabled.\n\n![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/671378/2241456/100db6b8-9cd3-11e3-9b3a-569c6b50cc60.png)\n",
