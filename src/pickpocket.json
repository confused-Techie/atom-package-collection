  "readme": "# PickPocket\n\nPickPocket is an [Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/pickpocket) for grabbing existing art assets from a collection and copying them into your current project. A file manager for game prototyping.\n\n![PickPocket](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/129330/17072386/ca12ef8e-5035-11e6-8626-19ccd95f3266.gif)\n\n## Usage\n\n* Install the package (Atom -> preferences -> install -> \"pickpocket\")\n* Launch PickPocket with **`ctrl-alt-p` (`pickpocket:toggle`)**.\n* Select image (and rename it if you want) then hit `import`.\n\nThe image is copied & renamed to the currently selected directory in your project. However, the assets you can choose are just a few examples (from [`<plugin root>/example`](https://github.com/mrspeaker/pickpocket/tree/master/example)) to get you started. You need to bring your own!\n\n* Dump a bunch of image assets in a directory somewhere, and put this location in `settings`.\n\nIf you select `import + open`, the local copy will be opened in your image editor (`aseprite` by default: change this in `settings`). When you import an image, the local path is also copied to the clipboard as a string - so you can paste it into your code.\n\n## Local project viewer\n\nThe `project` tab will show images already in your local project. You can `open` them in the current editor, or rename them to save-as a new duplicate image. You can also apply some effects with the `effects` button.\n\n## Effects\n\nSelect either a `project` or `pocket` image and hit `effects` ![fx](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/129330/23103327/c67b95ee-f687-11e6-8fd7-3de171d18687.png). This turns on effects mode where you can modify it before importing.\nCurrently there are a few effects you can apply: Flip x and y, rotate 90 degrees as well as some color effects (hue rotate, saturation, contrast, brightness). More to come.\n\n![effects screen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/129330/23129662/88ba08e2-f751-11e6-95c1-11e569f98264.png)\n\nNote: the effects are applied using HTML5 canvas, and the saved files will (for now) only be PNG files.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nHere's [some things I'm thinking about](https://github.com/mrspeaker/pickpocket/issues/3).\n\n![PickPocket](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/129330/17072516/e57a0e00-5036-11e6-9293-493de4d643b1.png)\n",
