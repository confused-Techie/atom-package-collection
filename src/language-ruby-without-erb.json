  "readme": "# Ruby (Only) language support in Atom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jtokoph/language-ruby-without-erb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jtokoph/language-ruby-without-erb)\n\n**Based on [atom/language-ruby](https://github.com/atom/language-ruby)**\n\nI wanted to prioritize the language-ruby-on-rails grammar for `.erb` files but atom doesn't support language/grammar priorities.\n\nMy previous solution was to just remove ERB definitions in the `atom/language-ruby` package on the filesystem. But now that atom packages everything in `asar` files, it's a little more complicated.\n\nThis package disables the `atom/language-ruby` package and replaces it without the ERB grammar.\n\nOriginally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)\nfrom the [Ruby TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/ruby.tmbundle).\nModified  [atom/language-ruby](https://github.com/atom/language-ruby) with ERB content stripped out.\n\nContributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a\npull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.\n",
