  "readme": "# AtomMasterSharing\n\nThis is an Atom plugin using the MasterSharing System for distributed group programming.\n\nThe system allows you to share a document with friends and colleagues for collaborative work.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Start Sharing\nOnly open a document and do one of these:\n- search for the 'Atom Master Sharing: StartSharing' command in the command palette and execute it\n- select it in the menu: Packages -> Atom Master Sharing -> StartSharing\n- press the shortcut 'ctrl-alt-p'\nYou will directly be connected to your own sharing session.\n\n\n### Connect to someone else\nTo connect to a sharing session of someone else, just do one of the following:\n- search for the 'Atom Master Sharing: Connect' command in the command palette and execute it\n- select the menu entry: Packages -> Atom Master Sharing -> Connect\n- press the shortcut 'ctrl-alt-o'\nAfterwards enter an url or ip-address with a port into the box that has opened at the top of the window and hit enter.\nYou should be connected to your partner now and can start working.\n\n\n### Browser\nWhen someone is sharing a document, you can also connect to the session via a browser.\nJust enter the same address as you would, if you were connecting with the atom client.\nA website will be opened and the content of the document will be visible.\n\nSo far the browser client is in readonly mode, so editing is not possible.\n\n\n### Ending a session and restarting\nUntil now this package is in a early development state.\nBecause of this, not every feature is completely finished.\nOne of the bigger problems for usage is, that no proper ending mechanism exists.\nSo if you want to stop sharing your document, save it and reload your atom window.\nThis is done with the `Window: Reload` command.\nSo open the command palette cmd/ctrl-shift-p, then enter `Window: Reload` and hit enter.\nThe shortcut to directly reload window is `ctrl-alt-r` on Windows/Linux and `ctrl-alt-cmd-l` on OSX.\nReloading the window stops the sharing session no matter if it is your session or someone else's.\n\n\n### Info\nIf you would like to change the standard port or color, just open the settings of the plugin an change them before usage.\nTherefore open the settings view of Atom, go to the packages tab, search for Atom Master Sharing and click on settings.\n\n\n## Note\nThis uses the npm module [MasterSharingCore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mastersharingcore), which is in an early state of development and should not yet be used in a productive environment.\nFeel free to have a look at its [code at github](https://github.com/okwast/MasterSharingCore).\n\nThe core parts of this plugin are found in the lib folder.\nThe entry point is the atom-master-sharing.coffee, where as the main part is found in the editorManager.coffee.\n",
