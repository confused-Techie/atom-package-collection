  "readme": "# dbl-click-select-inside-brackets package\n\nLots of code editors include the ability to select everything inside a matched pair of opening and closing brackets by double-clicking the opening or closing bracket.\n\nAtom has the excellent [bracket-matcher](https://atom.io/packages/bracket-matcher) package, which allows you to do this with the ctrl-cmd-m key combination, but I missed the double-click so much that I wrote a plugin to add it.\n\nThis package currently supports these bracket characters: () [] <> {} \n\nEnjoy!\n",
