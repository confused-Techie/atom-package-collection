Right click anywhere on the code, then select `Copy filepath with line numbers (relative path)`\n2. Press default shortcut key: `ctrl-l`. If you want to use your custom shortcut, bind your shortcut to this command `copy-filepath-with-line-numbers:relative` under `atom-workspace`\n3. Open command palette`cmd-shift-p`(MacOS) or `ctrl-shift-p`(Windows, Linux), then type `pathline` or similiar\n4.
