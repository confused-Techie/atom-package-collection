  "readme": "# auto-text package\n\nInserts text that you write depending on the filetype you chose.\n\n![Epic Screenshot](https://github.com/Quittime/auto-text/blob/master/auto-text.gif)\n\nJust a quick warning, you need to be very gentle with this program because it was thrown together really quickly. I will update this in the future, but for now, just be careful. Thank you for looking at this plugin!\n\nWriting code for this program is very simple. Once you toggle the program, a new file in your C:/Users/User folder will appear called \".autotext\". Open this up with your favorite text editor (aka atom), and now you can configure this program however you want... kinda.\n\nThere aren't too many commands. This program looks similar to html. You need to begin a command with \"'%<\" and end the command with \">&'\". Writing commands is a bit of a pain, but you can just copy and paste. So far, there are only 2 commands. \"type\" and \"text\". To end a command, you need to do /type or /text. You cannot place a command in a command so be careful.\nWARNING: WHEN TYPING COMMANDS, THEY NEED TO BE LOWERCASE!!!\nThis is how you write a program:\n\n'%<type>%'\n.cpp\n'%</type>%'\n'%<text>%'\nint main()\n{\n    OutputDebugStringA(\"Hello World\");\n}\n'%</text>%'\n\nThis program will paste this:\nint main()\n{\n    OutputDebugStringA(\"Hello World\");\n}\nin any file with the extension \".cpp\".\n\nThe type command is for setting the file extension it should paste the text into. The text command is for setting the text it should paste. It's very simple.\n\nThere are two extra things that you can also use. you can use %%name%% to insert the name of the file without the extension and %%NAME%% to paste the name of the file in uppercase letters without the extension. For example:\n\n'%<type>%'\n.txt\n'%</type>%'\n'%<text>%'\n%%name%%\n%%NAME%%\n'%</text>%'\n\nAssuming the name of the file is HelloWorld.txt, it would paste\n\nHelloWorld\nHELLOWORLD\n\nto the top of the file.\n\nWARNING: YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS PLUGIN. FOR EXAMPLE: YOU CANNOT FORMAT YOUR CODE LIKE THIS:\n'%<type>%'.txt'%</type>%'\nJUST BE VERY CAREFUL. FORMAT YOUR CODE EXACTLY HOW I DO. CONFIGURING THIS PLUGIN IS A PAIN BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TO DO IT ONCE. \n\n\n",
