  "readme": "# Woah There Mousewheel\n\n[Until](http://discuss.atom.io/t/scroll-performance-behavior/291)\n[the](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1666)\n[React](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1863)\n[editor](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2258) is implemented, it looks like\nscrolling in Atom for now will be a little bit janky compared to other apps.\nThis package is a pretty basic hack that'll slow down the scrolling down to\nsomething a bit more natural. Props to derek on the discussion site for the\n[original solution](http://discuss.atom.io/t/scroll-performance-behavior/291/21).\n\nNote that currently open tabs are unaffected when enabling or disabling the\npackage. It's a fun way to compare the scroll speed!\n\n## Installing\n\nUse the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or\nrun `apm install woah-there-mousewheel` from the command line.\n",
