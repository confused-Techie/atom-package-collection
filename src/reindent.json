  "readme": "# reindent\n\nQuickly re-indent your code!\n\n![demo.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbrose/atom-reindent/master/resources/demo.gif)\n\n<sub><sup>(You will also need the [`python-indent`](https://atom.io/packages/python-indent) package to achieve this exact behavior with Python files.)</sup></sub>\n\nChange the length of that variable name with impunity! Update your soft indentation length! Fix your co-workers mess! Fix *your* mess!\n\n## Usage\n\nHighlight the lines of code you want to re-indent, and activate the re-indent command either through the command palette (`ctrl-shift-p`) or by using the keybinding `ctrl-shift-r`.\n\n## How?\n\nThis package:\n\n* expands your selection to include full lines,\n* splits the selected text along the file's newline (or `\\n` if the file's newline character is unknown),\n* *deletes that text*,\n* re-inserts the text one line at a time with all preceding and trailing whitespace removed, running the command `editor:newline` after each line is inserted to automatically set the indentation level for the next line.\n\nThis package relies on Atom's built-in auto-indentation which is usually derived from a language package. *If the language package doesn't do a good job of indenting your code, then this package will not either.* In particular, languages with white-space based syntax (e.g. Python and Make) might have trouble.\n\nThe editor will take the first line of your selection as the base indentation level. Consider the code below:\n\n```\nfor x in y:\n print(x)\n```\n\nIf you highlight only the second line (`print(x)`) and reindent, then nothing will happen. You have to include the line `for x in y:` in your selection.\n\n# How to publish\n\nI am by no means a master of the `apm` tool, so this I'm putting down the process for publishing.\n\n0. Make changes, merge into master etc.\n1. `git checkout master`\n2. `git pull`\n3. Edit the CHANGELOG, putting a line in for the new version.\n4. `git add CHANGELOG.md; git commit -m \"updating changelog\"; git push`\n5. If you're feeling paranoid, wait for CI to finish running on that push to master.\n6. `apm publish [major | minor | patch | build]` **Note that this will automatically update package.json with the new version number!**\n\n\n----------\n\n![](https://travis-ci.org/kbrose/atom-reindent.svg?branch=master)\n\nhttps://github.com/kbrose/atom-reindent\n",
