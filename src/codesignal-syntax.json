  "readme": "# codesignal-syntax theme\n\nThis theme was created to maximize readability when writing code. It is based on the coding practice platform CodeSignal.\n\nHowever, some modifications were made that include my own personal preferences, so it's not identical to that on the CodeSignal website. \n\nSome simple slight adjustments could be made to make it exactly the same.\n\nExample code in C++ is featured below:\n\n![A screenshot of your theme](https://github.com/harmichimo/atom-codesignal-theme/blob/main/codesignal-clone.png?raw=true)\n",
