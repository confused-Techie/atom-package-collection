  "readme": "# Kary Foundation's Light Theme for Atom\n\nThis is the official [Kary Foundation's Light Syntax Theme](https://github.com/karyfoundation/syntax-theme) for GitHub Atom.\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2157285/17080845/f2fb9516-5154-11e6-8397-877ab145531c.png)\n\n\n## What is this?\nThis page obviously is about a syntax theme, but for this one we have somehow a back story that is way different than just different coloring.\n\nWhen people say beautiful codes they always mean less complexity or clever code but when we say that we mean it for real. The code must look nice when you read it. In order to manage the code we invented [Kary Foundation’s Coding Style (KFCS)](https://github.com/karyfoundation/comment/wiki) and the fact that we have a very restricted way of [coding style](http://kary.us/2015/02/12/arendelle-coding-styles/). \n\nNow beauty matters but also it’s the psychology that matters. As developers what you see all day long is code. So it matters that the code be pretty and it matters that your editor is pretty because well it’s your life happening behind it. But how should it look? what colors must be there? \n\nFor what we know we all are playful people. We have an active inner child. Our editors must look like playgrounds. We have developed a rainbow colored theme. With worm colors chosen very carefully for the finest code quality possible. \n\nFrom what we noticed [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) has the most carefully defined experience. We loved the `gold` and `red`/`orange` colors used by their highlighter and inspired by their design we shaped a coding experience that for us was the most joyful look of the code ever possible. \n\n## The theme…\n#### JavaScript / TypeScript\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-23 at 1 12 03 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2157285/17077044/7f25599c-50d7-11e6-8511-69f286698743.png\">\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-23 at 1 12 22 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2157285/17077045/7fb1bd6a-50d7-11e6-867d-cd90e7d21151.png\">\n\n#### Ruby\n<img width=\"641\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-24 at 3 44 16 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2157285/17080757/077c4aac-5151-11e6-9182-a7f91985a723.png\">\n\n#### Arendelle\n<img width=\"510\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-24 at 3 35 36 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2157285/17080732/e87e1a0a-514f-11e6-9227-43aca3767aba.png\">\n\n#### CSS / Less\n<img width=\"626\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-23 at 1 00 09 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2157285/17077053/b0c38b0e-50d7-11e6-831a-82a5df23a0de.png\">\n\n#### HTML / XML\n<img width=\"523\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-23 at 4 23 56 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2157285/17077057/ccbf5fcc-50d7-11e6-855c-9521a450f9c5.png\">\n\n#### Pageman\n<img width=\"801\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-24 at 3 39 47 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2157285/17080746/7c164e86-5150-11e6-8adf-1dae193d48f6.png\">\n\n#### JSON\n<img width=\"596\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-23 at 1 03 12 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2157285/17077058/ddfce520-50d7-11e6-82a9-eab20c5babfb.png\">\n\n## How to use it?\n#### Visual Studio Code\nIt's available from the marketplace, Just simply run:\n```\next install theme-karyfoundation-themes\n```\n\n#### Sublime Text\nAfter cloning this repo in your Sublime use `Preferences` > `Browse Packages…` open the folder and put `.tmTheme` files from the `Themes` folder into it. \n\n#### Atom\nUse our official ports for Atom available via atom package manager (APM):\n- [Kary Foundation Light](https://atom.io/packages/kary-foundation-light)\n- [Kary Foundation Dark](https://atom.io/packages/kary-foundation-dark)\n\n#### Any other editor that supports .tmThemes\nFiles are provided under the `Themes` directory. Use your editors guides and install the themes.\n\n## Good font to use with this theme?\nTo use it best, we suggest you use the [ _Medium_ weight of _Adobe Source Code Pro_ ](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro) typeface. they are the best matches for each other :D\n\n## What's new?\n#### 3.0.0\n- Visual Studio Code and Atom versions are now compatible with each other.\n#### 1.5.2\n- **New!** &madsh; Operator Keywords now render just like normal text. (better right?).\n\n#### 1.5.1\n- **Fix!** &mdash; As [it turns out](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9629) Mac uses a _Gamma 1.8 RGB_ but the standard for tmThemes are sRGB. Thanks to the great tool [\"tmTheme Color Conventor\"](https://github.com/jibsen/tmcolorconv) the theme has being fixed and the colors no longer looks dark!\n\n#### 1.4.5\n- **New!** &mdash; TypeScript's _Type Cast Expression_ now has custom coloring.\n\n#### 1.4.4\n- **New!** &mdash; Custom string color for HTML added.\n- **Fix!** &mdash; Markdown Heading color changed to be more hormonic.\n\n#### 1.4.3\n- **New!** &mdash; Custom color for TypeScript class storage modifiers (`public`, `private`, ...)\n\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.karyfoundation.org/\">\n    <img src=\"http://www.karyfoundation.org/foundation/logo/github-full-horse.png\" width=\"250\"/>\n</a>",
