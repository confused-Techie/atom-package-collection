  "readme": "# AutoHotKey support for Atom\n\nThis package adds basic syntax highlighting support for .ahk files in Atom.\n\n![Screenshot of a New AutoHotKey Script](screenshot.png)\n\nScreenshot taken of \"New AutoHotKey Script.ahk\" included in the project.  \n\nProps to Dayle Rees and his beautifully designed *Revalation* theme: [daylerees/colour-schemes](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes \"daylerees/colour-schemes\") \n\n\n## Features\nSyntax highlighting support for the following match types:\n* Quoted strings\n* Percent sign enclosed strings\n* Comment lines\n* Numbers\n* Directives\n* Built-in system variables\n* Named key constants\n* Function declarations\n* Commonly used hotkey modifiers and symbols () English\n\n## Planned Features\nThese are features that I soon hope to implement and/or improve upon in future updates:\n* Snippets for all system variables and functions\n* General improvements to the regular expression formulas used for syntax matching\n* Code folding support\n* File system commands for reloading/pausing/compiling AHK scripts.\n\n## About\nI'm not entirely sure why I find AutoHotKey to be so extremely satisfying but you can understand my frustration at having a lack of support for my favorite new text editor.  So I figured, why not make it myself!  So I learned some stuff about Atom, improved my RegEx skills and created my first project that can actually be used by everyone.  \n\nThis is my first real experience in building a plugin for an application and I'm really excited to be making this available to others who can benefit from it as I do.\n\nThank you to everyone who installs and enjoys using this package.  Hope you love it!!!\n",
