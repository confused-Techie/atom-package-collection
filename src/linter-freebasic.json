  "readme": "# linter-freebasic package\n\nLint FreeBASIC on the fly using the FreeBASIC compiler.\n\n\n## Project-specific include paths\nIf your project has some extra include directories, put them in a file called \".linter-freebasic-includes\" and list them line by line.\nThe linter will open the file and use the specified paths when linting in your project.\n\nYou can put your \".linter-freebasic-includes\" files in subdirectories, too, the linter will find them and include the paths relative to the file they are specified in.\n\n## Project-specific compiler flags\nIf your project has some extra compiler flags, put them in a file called \".linter-freebasic-flags\" and list all flags.\nThe linter will open the file and use the specified flags when linting in your project.\nYou can put your flag file in subdirectories, too, however, no resolving of paths will take place.\nFor that, you can use macros (see below).\n\nNote: Whenever there is a space in the flag file it will separate the strings before and after\nwhen passing them as arguments to the compiler (like in the command line).\nIf you have a filename with a space, put it into quotes. Everything between quotes won't\nbe separated. The quotes will be removed after parsing.\nUsing quotes is therefore not supported yet (TODO: let the user put a backslash to escape the quote).\n\n## Macros\n\nThe linter will expand the following macros in your \".linter-freebasic-includes\" and \".linter-freebasic-flags\" files:\n * `%d` -> the directory of the file being linted\n * `%p` -> the project path\n * `%%` -> `%`\n",
