  "readme": "# What's this?\n\nThis is an atom package that provides keymaps for the tree-view when you're\nusing vim-mode-plus. This could _technically_ be used without vim-mode-plus, but\nif you want vim bindings anyway, you'll probably have vim-mode-plus installed.\n\nMy goal is to provide similar mappings to vim's NERDTree plugin. However,\ncurrently, I don't plan to write any custom commands to accomplish this. The\nscope of this package is to solely provide keymaps for existing commands. So the\navailable NERDTree provided keymappings will be limited (though, I believe,\nuseful).\n\n:rotating_light: **This package provides keymaps only.**\n\nProvides the following keymaps:\n\n| Keystroke | Description                                                |\n| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |\n| o         | Open file in previous window                               |\n| O         | Recursively open directory (or files parent directory)     |\n| x         | Recursively collapse directory (or files parent directory) |\n| g g       | Move to top                                                |\n| G         | Move to bottom                                             |\n| m a       | Add file                                                   |\n| m d       | Remove file                                                |\n| m m       | Move file                                                  |\n| i         | Open Split (Vertically)                                    |\n| s         | Open Split (Horizontally)                                  |\n\n## Recommended keymap.cson addition\n\nIf you'd like to quickly toggle the tree-view, you can add something like:\n\n```cson\n'body':\n  ', n': 'tree-view:toggle'\n```\n\nI didn't include this in this package because everyone has different preferences\nfor <leader> (in vim-speak). You might want to use 'space n' or '\\\\ n'. It's up\nto you. Personally, I enjoy using ','.\n\n## LICENSE\n\nGPLv3. See LICENSE for more details.\n",
