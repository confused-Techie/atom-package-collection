  "readme": "# Stacktrace for Atom\n\n*Navigate stacktraces within Atom!*\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smashwilson/stacktrace.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smashwilson/stacktrace?branch=master)\n\nGiven a stacktrace from a supported language, this package gives you:\n\n * A mile-high view of the full trace, with a few lines of context on each stack\n   frame;\n * Highlighting and navigation tools to walk up and down the stack while you're\n   looking at the full files.\n * *[planned]* Intelligent mappings from paths from other systems to yours. If it looks like\n   a ruby gem path, it'll map into your `${GEM_HOME}`; if it looks like a\n   virtualenv path, it'll map into your virtualenv.\n\n## Installation\n\n```apm install stacktrace```\n\n## Obligatory Animated Gif\n\n![walkthrough](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17565/4100060/aa761e90-307e-11e4-83c8-e4bf04c20d95.gif)\n\n## Commands\n\nStacktrace is a **Bring Your Own Keybinding** :tm: package. Rather than try to guess a set of bindings that won't collide with any other package, or that aren't six-key chords, I'm not providing any default keybindings.\n\nTo set hotkeys for stacktrace commands, invoke `Application: Open Your Keymap` from the command palette, and add a section like this one:\n\n```coffee\n'.workspace':\n  'alt-s enter': 'stacktrace:from-selection'\n  'alt-s p': 'stacktrace:paste'\n  'alt-s up': 'stacktrace:to-caller'\n  'alt-s down': 'stacktrace:follow-call'\n```\n\n## Language Support\n\nStacktraces are currently recognized in the following languages:\n\n * Ruby\n * (Java|Coffee)script\n\n## Countdown to 1.0\n\nIn the true spirit of README-driven development, these are the features that I'd\nlike to see in place before I mark it 1.0.\n\n- [x] Accept stacktraces pasted into a dialog you call up from the command\n  palette.\n- [x] Present a view that gives you bits of context around each frame of a\n  specific stack.\n- [x] Pluggable stacktrace recognition and parsing code.\n- [ ] Map parsed frames to source files on the local filesystem.\n- [x] While a stacktrace is active, highlight individual lines from the trace\n  in open editors.\n- [x] Provide commands for next-frame, previous-frame, and turning it off.\n- [x] Show a stacktrace navigation view as a bottom panel with next, previous\n  and stop buttons.\n",
