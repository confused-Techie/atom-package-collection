Their % contributions are also shown.\n\nScreenshot of the tool run on the awesome list repo's readme file:\n![Screenshot of the tool run on the awesome list repo's readme file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groktools/git-authors/master/git-authors.jpg)\n\n#Why git-authors\nAs found by [Maalej et al](https://mobis.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TOSEM-Maalej-Comprehension-PrePrint2.pdf) (page 20):\n> The more people developers know, the easier they can identify which ex- perience is worth sharing, with whom, and how.\n\nThis repo contains a simple Atom plugin to bridge this gap. It displays the list of authors along with their percentage contribution to the file by line.\n\n# Install\n\nDownload via Atom Packages.\n\n# Usage\n\nOnce installed, the `git-authors` shows up in the UI and can be invoked by typing `ctrl-opt-a` or `Packages->git-authors-toggle`. This displays a list of authors with their percentage contribution to the file\n",
