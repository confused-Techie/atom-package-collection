  "readme": "# User Story snippets and highlighting\n\nA simple package which extends the atom editor with syntax highlighting and snippets for user stories. Pretty much work in progress.\n\n## Highlighting\nThe format currently supported follows the textbook style format.\n```\nAs a <ROLE> I want <GOAL> so that <REASON>.\n```\n\nYou can deviate a bit from the version above. All examples below would be recognized by the parser:\n\n```\n# Some feature\nAs a USER I would like to have syntax highlighting for user stories so that I can better visually parse them.\nThe user would like to have syntax highlighting for user stories so that he can visually parse them.\na user would like to have syntax highlighting\n```\n\nThe representation in atom using the solarized-dark syntax theme:\n![sample image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fschaper/atom-language-story/master/support/sample.jpg)\n\n## Snippets\n\nCurrently three expansions are offered:\n- `asn` will expand to `As an {ROLE} I want {GOAL} so that {REASON}.`\n- `asa` in turn will expand to `As a {ROLE} I want {GOAL} so that {REASON}.`\n- 'ast' expands to `As the <ROLE>, I want <GOAL> so that <REASON>.`\n\n## Autocomplete\n\nThere is autocomplete support for the users role.\n\n## Reference Material\n\n- [Martin Fowler on User Stories](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UserStory.html)\n",
