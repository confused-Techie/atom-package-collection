  "readme": "# draw-package for Atom\n\nSimple package for drawing Ascii-art in your text file.\n\nThis is more like an experiment for me, for learning, but feel welcome to comment\nor even contribute to this project.\n\nCurrently, drawing is pretty destructive so don't draw inside text\nor other art you want to keep :)...\n\nAdding lines or moving to line that is shorter than previous line, will result\nthat the line will be filled with canvas.\n\nCtrl-Alt    i\t- draw up\n\t\t\tk  - draw down\n\t\t\tj  - draw left\n\t\t\tl - draw right\n\t\t\tu     - create canvas line (fill with 80 x .)\n\t\t\to\t - finish selection (replace . with whitespace)\n\nissues : Problem with tab / space behavior in Atom. Or the author doesn't fully\nunderstand it - this would get rid of using the dot canvas. Probably some new after removing deprecations...\n\nNo tests written yet.\n\n\n![A screenshot of draw-package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/erkkikeranen/draw-package/draw-package-demo-movie.gif)\n",
