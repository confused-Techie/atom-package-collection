  "readme": "# Show In Folder\n\nAn [Atom](http://atom.io) package.\n\nProvides a command to open the folder containing the file in the active editor, much like the _Show in Explorer_ option in the tree-view context menu.\n\n![Screenshot of command](./docs/show-in-folder.gif)\n\nThere are no keybindings associated with this package by default. Add a keybinding using your keymap and the selector ` atom-text-editor`.\n\nIf you'd prefer modifying your init script instead of installing the package, add the following (the package just adds this command):\n\n```\n# show in folder\natom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor', 'init:show-in-folder', ->\n  {shell} = require('electron')\n  sPath = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor().getPath()\n  shell.showItemInFolder(sPath)\n```\n",
