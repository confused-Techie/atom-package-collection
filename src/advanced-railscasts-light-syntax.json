  "readme": "# Advanced Railscasts Syntax Theme\n\nMy experiment to create a syntax theme that employs some [advanced highlighting techniques][advanced] that are only available to Atom.\n\nThis theme is based upon the [Railscasts theme by Ryan Bates][railscasts] and the [Base16 Railscasts theme][base16] by Chris Kempson.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL\n\nThis theme is to be considered *highly* experimental. Released versions may contain annoying color combinations, flashing text, strange animations or other weirdness. Side effects may include:\n\n* Nausea/vomiting\n* Piercing pain in the eyes, head and/or neck\n* Rash or other irritation of the skin, mouth, nose and/or throat\n* Loss of consciousness or \"missing time\" episodes\n* Desire to gouge out one's own eyes\n* Temporary or permanent insanity\n\nYou have been warned. :wink:\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright &copy; 2014-2015 by [Lee Dohm](http://www.lee-dohm.com) and [Lifted Studios](http://www.liftedstudios.com).
