  "readme": "# Quicklaunch\n\nAllows to launch any file in your project hierarchy through a terminal window.\nTerminal applications will launch inside the terminal, GUI applications will launch as usual with the terminal showing possible console output of the application.\n\n# Usage\n\nSimply right-click the item in the project tree-view and hit \"Run\" in the context menu, right-click into any open text editor and click \"Run\" in the context menu or navigate to \"Packages>Quicklaunch>Run active\". Alternatively the default shortcut \"alt-r\" will have the same effect.\n\n![Workflow demonstration](https://i.imgur.com/nli1sfF.gif)\n",
