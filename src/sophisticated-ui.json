  "readme": "# Sophisticated UI\n\nI love Atom.IO and use it daily, so I wanted to make a 'pretty' theme that's more elegant than what I had been using. As this was my first theme, I decided to start from a forked version of [Nucleus Dark UI](https://github.com/ignism/nucleus-dark-ui).\n\n#### Installation\n\nIn Atom:\nSettings > Install > Themes > Search for 'Sophisticated'\n\nVia terminal:\n```\napm install sophisticated-ui\n```\n\n#### Requirements\n\nRight now, since this was forked originally, you need to have a syntax theme that has a syntax-variables.less.\n\nAs time permits, I am working to remove requirement.\n\n#### ETC\n\nAll feedback is welcome.\n\n#### Screens\n\nHere's an initial screen showing Sophisticated UI 0.2.0 with the syntax theme Sophisticated Syntax (in progress). More screens to come.\n\n![Sophisticated UI](http://i.imgur.com/KF1m59n.png)\n",
