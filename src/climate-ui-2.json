  "readme": "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmcalaway/climate-ui/master/climate-header.png)\n---\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmcalaway/climate-ui/master/theme-screenshot-new.png)\n\n**Climate UI** is a user interface theme for [Climate Syntax](https://github.com/jmcalaway/climate-syntax) designed intuitively to make Atom feel more intelligent and complimentary to your workflow. With features such as *File Themes* and a true *Distraction-Free Mode*, **Climate UI** makes development stand out where it needs to and blend when distracting. There's a tipping scale when it comes to text editors that begs to find a balance between being attractive and being useful. Here's a bit of both.\n\n\n# Theme Tour\n### Add Unique File Themes for Easy Management\nAdd unique color schemes per file type and always know what language you're working with!\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmcalaway/climate-ui/master/file-color-themes.gif)\n\n### Do What Works Best for You\nAdd new color schemes or revise existing ones!\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmcalaway/climate-ui/master/change-color.gif)\n\n### True Distraction Free Tree View\nWith **Distraction-Free Mode**, only see the files you're working with!\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmcalaway/climate-ui/master/distraction-free-mode.gif)\n\n### Attractive & Seamless User Experience\n**Climate UI** is designed to feel new and seamless!\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmcalaway/climate-ui/master/ui-demonstration.gif)\n\n# Installation\nWith the terminal open, punch in the following:\n\n```shell\napm install climate-ui\n```\n\n# Brand\nEnthused about the **Climate Atom Theme Suite**? How's about an icon to match!\n\n[![Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmcalaway/climate-ui/master/download.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmcalaway/climate-ui/master/climate-dock-icon.png)\n\n# Donation\nThank you for taking interest in the Climate Atom Theme! If you'd like to keep me up and working, you're certainly welcome to.\n\n[![Donate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmcalaway/climate-ui/master/donate.png)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=8ZV7PP9C8YCZE)\n\n# Credit\nThis UI was made with the assistance of [PeterJohn Hunt](https://atom.io/users/peterjohnhunt)",
