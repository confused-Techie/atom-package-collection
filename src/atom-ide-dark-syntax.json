  "readme": "# Atom IDE Dark Syntax theme\n\n![atom-ide-dark-syntax](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanolsonx/atom-ide-dark-syntax/master/screenshot.png)\n\n> The font used in this screenshot is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)\n\nI really liked the [theme](https://ide.atom.io/) that is used for the screencasts on the atom ide promotional page. I hear that the developer that did the screencasts is out of office for some months and that the theme he/she was using was a custom theme that hasn't been released. So I made it! I based this off of [Atom One Dark Syntax](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax).\n\nI haven't tested this for many languages, so if you see any odd syntax highlighting for a language, please submit an issue.\n",
