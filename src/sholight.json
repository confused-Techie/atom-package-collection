  "readme": "# sholight theme #\n\nThis is a very light, highly saturated theme based on the four-color palette used in the Sho documentation. Its airy look-and-feel emphasizes the sparse, easy aesthetic of languages like Ruby and Haskell: however, its high-contrast and varied color scheme makes it eyestrain-free.\n\nUse a large font size and your formatting will look presentation-ready.\n\n## Samples ##\n\n### Haskell ###\n![Sholight (Haskell source code)](http://i.imgur.com/yWrlcbY.png)\n\n### Python ###\n![Sholight (Python source code)](http://i.imgur.com/WmDDAGV.png)\n\n### Ruby ###\n![Sholight (Ruby source code)](http://i.imgur.com/N1nuqcU.png)\n",
