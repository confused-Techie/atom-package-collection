  "readme": "# george-atom package\n\n## Usage\n`Cmd-Shift-G` (`Ctrl-Shift-G` for windows/linux users) to ask george, using the entire contents of your current text editor as input.\n\nResults will show up in a notification.\n\n**NEW:** You can now use the command `create-files` (from the packages menu or the command palette) to have george-atom create a file for each problem in the current assignment and populate each file with the initial text given to us on the SE 212 site.\ngeorge-atom determines your assignment number by scanning through your open projects and finding one with a number in it -- so make sure to have something like \"Assignment 3\" or \"A6\" as your assignment folder. Also, if you happen to have another project folder with a different number in it, george-atom might choose that one, so.. don't :)\n\nAlso, adds syntax highlighting thanks to [@georgeutsin](https://github.com/georgeutsin)\n",
