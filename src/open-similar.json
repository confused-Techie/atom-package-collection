  "readme": "# Open Similar package for Atom text editor\n\nOpen files with the same filename but different file extensions in the same directory with a simple hotkey.\nThis package is very useful when working with Angular 2's file naming convention.\n\nDefault hotkey: `cmd+ctrl+e`\n\nExample use folder structure:\n\n    -componentFolder  \n    |-my.component.ts  \n    |-my.component.html  \n    |-my.component.css  \n\nIf you're working on `my.component.html` and you want to quickly open `my.component.ts` and `my.component.css`, without digging through your filetree, this is the package for you.\n\nBuilt by [Elliot Plant](www.elliotplant.com) while working at [Index](www.index.com).\n",
