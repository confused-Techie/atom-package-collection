  "readme": "# Lodash.js Snippets for Atom\nSome snippets to quickly use lodash library in Atom.\n\n# Note:\nThis is a fork of project `lodash-snippets` by @richtmat, which in turn was inspired by `atom-undescorejs` (@tianp). I forked the project because of the styling difference between @richtmat and me.\nI don't like spaces between my parentheses but apparently he likes it, moreover the parentheses weren't even consistent, which drived me nuts so.\n\n## Install\n```bash\napm install lodash-snippets\n```\nOr\n```\nSettings ➔ Install ➔ Search for `lodash`\n```\n\n## License\n[MIT](LICENSE.md) © [Matthias Richter](https://github.com/richtmat)\n",
