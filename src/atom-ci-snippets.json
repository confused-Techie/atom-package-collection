  "readme": "# atom-ci-snippets\n\nCodeigniter snippets for Atom are based on this repository https://github.com/mpmont/ci-snippets\n\nI used to work a lot with those snippets when I was a Sublime Text user so I decided to port'em to Atom's and that was it!\n\nThe snippets from the _inspirational_ repository were just converted from Sublime Text to Atom's format. There are still improvements to be made in some of them, so, feel free to create an issue if you find some (or send a pull request). Anyway, the snippets are already pretty usable and keep improving my productivity! :)\n\n## Contributing\n\nThere are three main ways to contribute to this repository:\n\n### Sync from the Sublime Text repository\n\nThe Sublime Text snippets repo (check the link in the references) is active and there are often new snippets. If you found that there are new snippets and they aren't here yet, use the `convert.rb` script to translate the `master` branch of the Sublime Text repository and send a pull request with the new generated snippet file.\n\n### Send your own snippets\n\nIf you think that there are still missing any useful snippet (surelly there are some), you can write it, test for your own usage and send a pull request. Just be sure to follow the specs for Atom snippets format (see the link in the references) and write it to a separate file in the `snippets` directory of this repository.\n\n### Whatever you want\n\nFeel free to make any improvements you think it's useful and send a pull request.\n\n## References\n\n* **Atom package repository link:** https://atom.io/packages/atom-ci-snippets\n* **Atom snippets documentation:** http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/snippets/\n* **Codeigniter Sublime Text snippets:** https://github.com/mpmont/ci-snippets\n",
