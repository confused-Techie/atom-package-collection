  "readme": "## Dota 2 KV package for [Atom](https://atom.io/)\n\n### About this package\n\nI'm very new to the modding scene, and also very new to atom packaging (first try); so any suggestion/help is much appreciated and expected since there are a lot of flaws in my syntax (especially when it comes to indentation).\n\nThis package is a blatant port of the [Dota KV package for Sublime Text](https://github.com/bhargavrpatel/dota_kv). All credit should go to the author of that package, as this is mostly his work revised.\n\nI have also used [this script](https://github.com/james2doyle/sublime-to-atom-snippets) to convert the code snippets.\n\nMany thanks to the authors and I'm very sorry for any kind of copyright infringement as I am completely new to this.\n\n### TODO\n\n- [ ] Fixing indentation problems with snippets\n- [ ] Add settings\n",
