  "readme": "# Cylc language package for Atom\n\nAn Atom extension that provides language support for Cylc workflow configuration files.\n\n## Features\n\nSyntax highlighting:\n- Cylc 7\n- Cylc 8\n- ISO 8601 datetimes\n- Jinja2 (can be used with a Jinja extension e.g. [atom-jinja2](https://atom.io/packages/atom-jinja2))\n\nCheck [here](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/2752) for info on supported syntax features.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall from the Atom settings, [the Atom website](https://atom.io/packages/language-cylc), or by running `apm install language-cylc`.\n\nBy default, only files called `suite.rc` and `suite.rc.processed` (and with the future Cylc 8 extension `.cylc`) will use the package. If you want all `.rc` files to use it: in Atom, go to `Edit > Config...` and add the desired extension to your Atom config file under `core.customFileTypes.source.cylc`, like this:\n```cson\n\"*\":\n  core:\n    customFileTypes:\n      \"source.cylc\": [\n        \"rc\"\n      ]\n```\n\n## Issues\n\nPlease report any syntax highlighting issues at [cylc/cylc-textmate-grammar](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-textmate-grammar/issues). Any other issues with the extension should be reported [here](https://github.com/cylc/language-cylc/issues).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis repo includes the [cylc/cylc-textmate-grammar](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-textmate-grammar) repo as a git submodule. If you don't have experience with submodules, you should [read the docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) first.\n\nThe cylc-textmate-grammar repo contains a JSON TextMate grammar file which is used by Atom for syntax highlighting (symlinked to by `grammars/cylc.json`). Read the [Atom guide on creating a TextMate grammar](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/creating-a-legacy-textmate-grammar/) for more information. **Note:** do not edit the JSON file when contributing; instead you should edit the JavaScript grammar file and build it, as explained in the [contributing](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-textmate-grammar#contributing) section of cylc-texmate-grammar. Any edits will be part of that repo as opposed to this repo.\n\nTo install a development copy of the package:\n```\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cylc/language-cylc.git\ncd language-cylc\napm link --dev\n```\nThe `--recurse-submodules` option automatically initialises the cylc-textmate-grammar submodule. `apm link --dev` symlinks the clone to `~/.atom/dev/` so that it is loaded when you run Atom in dev mode:\n```\natom --dev .\n```\n\nYou can then edit the `cylc-textmate-grammar/src/cylc.tmLanguage.js` grammar file. First, [read the contributing section](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-textmate-grammar#contributing) of the cylc-textmate-grammar repo - any such edits will be part of that repo as opposed to this vscode-cylc repo. Remember to run `npm build` inside `cylc-texmate-grammar` after editing & saving the file. Reload the dev window using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd>.\n\nContributions to Atom-specific features are to be made in this repo, not the submodule.\n",
