  "readme": "# Focus White\n[![use-with][use-with-badge]][use-with-url]\n[![git][git-badge]][git-url]\n[![apm][apm-badge]][apm-url]\n[![nearform][nearform-badge]][nearform-url]\n\nFocus White is a hyper minimal syntax theme for [Atom.io][] which removes superfluous highlighting in\nfavor of more focused highlighting that helps draw the eye to read instead of just acknowledging keywords by\ncolor.\n\n![js-sample][]\n\n## How To Install\nIt is recommended that packages are installed via APM or Atom's package management interface. Packages should\nonly be installed manually when you want to modify, debug, or otherwise change the package itself. Manually\ninstalled packages will not take advantage of Atom's updater mechanism.\n\n### Via Atom's preferences pane\n\n1. Open atom's preferences pane\n2. On the sidebar, choose install\n3. Toggle the _search packages_ search bar to Themes\n3. In the _search themes_ box, search for _focus white_\n4. Choose the correct package, the author will be _mcdonnelldean_\n5. Hit install on the the found package\n6. Select Themes from the sidebar\n7. In the themes dropdown select Focus White\n8. Restart any instances of Atom.io\n\n### Using APM\n\n1. Open the command line\n2. Run `apm install focus-white`\n3. Open atom's preferences pane\n4. Select Themes from the sidebar\n5. In the themes dropdown select Focus White\n6. Restart any instances of Atom.io\n\n### Manually\n\n1. Fork this repository\n2. Pull down your fork via github\n3. Open the terminal in the package's root directory\n4. Run `apm link`, which will symlink the package to Atom\n5. Open atom's preferences pane\n6. Select Themes from the sidebar\n7. In the themes dropdown select Focus White\n8. Restart any instances of Atom.io\n\n## Supported Languages\nLanguage support is on a per needed basis. If you need a particular language to be supported, create an\nissues with some sample code to use and I will include support for it with the next feature update.\n\n- Javascript\n- CSS / LESS / SCSS\n- Markdown\n- JSON\n\nNote that this theme styles the full editor pane, that means the whole pane, including gutters and\ngutter symbols will be overridden for styling. This is in line with Atom's best practices for Syntax vs\nUI theming.\n\n## Contributing\nFocus White is an __open project__ and encourages participation regardless or race, gender, or sexual\norientation. If you feel you can help in any way please be our guest.
