  "readme": "# UnrealScript language support Atom #\n\nSyntax highlighting for UnrealScript (.uc) files, used by Unreal Engine 3. Currently only supports basic C/C++ snippets, does not have any specific to UnrealScript itself.\n\nI noticed Atom did not yet have a syntax package for the language, so I thought I'd make one.  It will load for any file with the .uc extension.\n\nContributions to the language are more than welcome, in fact I actively encourage others to Fork the repo and create pull requests.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall the package `language-unrealscript` in Atom (Preferences->Packages) or Atom's package manager from a shell:\n\n```bash\n$ apm install language-unrealscript\n```\n\n## Issues/Bugs ##\n\nAs UnrealScript is based heavily on C++, this is package is essentially just a bare bones fork of the C++ language package for Atom with some added functions/classes used by only by UnrealEngine.\n\nPlease feel free to report any problems with the language package by opening an issue or by all means, fix it and make a pull request. Equally goes for any improvements that you wish to make, I will happily look through and merge.\n\n## Contributors ##\n\npoosh\n",
