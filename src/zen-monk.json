  "readme": "# Minimalism Itself\n\nDisable Atom.io syntax highlighting, except for comments and strings.\n\nInspired by some articles stating that disabling syntax highlighting is actually a good thing. It should lower distractions and allow more focus on the meaning of the code. I wanted to try this in Atom.io.\n\n# Installation\n\nFire up a console and type:\n\n```shell\napm install zenmonk\n```\n\nOr, inside Atom's settings select Install and then search for this theme.\n",
