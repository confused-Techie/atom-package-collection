  "readme": "# Notebook UI Theme for Atom\n\nAtom wants to look like an old notebook. Like this.\n\n![Notebook UI](screenshots/notebook-ui-main.png)\n\n**Let it.**\n\nNotebook UI styles most core elements to make Atom feel right at home in the early centuries. Or in a videogame based in early centuries. Either way, it's what Atom wants.\n\n## Built on Atom One and Fira Code\n\nNotebook UI is based entirely on [Atom One Light UI](https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui) which excels at blending UI styles with syntax theme colors, unlike [other themes](https://atom.io/themes/blueprint-ui). Notebook UI's styles don't mesh with as many themes as Atom One but it looks great with probably all light or solarized syntax themes.\n\nIt also relies on [Fira Code iScript](https://github.com/kencrocken/FiraCodeiScript) for handwritten font styling.\n\n## Beautifully archaic\n\nFull-screen using Solarized Light. Atom icon remains in view, just like Atom always wanted.\n![Notebook UI Fullscreen](screenshots/notebook-ui-fullscreen.png)\n\nSettings use rotated hues to help distinguish from other sections.\n![Notebook UI Settings](screenshots/notebook-ui-settings.png)\n\nFind-in-project also uses different hues.\n![Notebook UI Find-in-project](screenshots/notebook-ui-find-in-project.png)\n\nKNOWN BUGS\n* No START or PLAY button.\n* Makes all text crooked, wat?\n* Playing Nethack in a terminal with this theme is impossibly slow.\n",
