  "readme": "atom-stash-tabs\n===============\nI created this as I'm often working on a set of files, and something comes up (i.e. a bug needs to be fixed) and I need to switch context, but don't want to lose all of the tabs I have open for my current work-flow.  This package allows you to stash the current set of tabs and re-open them later.  It's pretty basic and rough around the edges, but does what I need for now.\n",
