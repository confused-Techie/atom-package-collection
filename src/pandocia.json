  "readme": "# Pandocia\n\n_Currently in alpha stage development_\n\nConvert files between different document formats.\nSee [pandoc.org](https://pandoc.org) for more information.\n\n**NOTE:**\nThis package uses [simple-pandoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-pandoc)\nand requires pandoc to be install on your system.\n\n## Installing pandoc on your system\n\nBelow is information taken from the Pandoc Installation guide.\n\nSee [the full guide](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) for\nfurther instructions.\n\n\n### Windows\n\n - There is a package installer at pandoc's\n   [download page](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/latest).\n   This will install pandoc, replacing older versions, and\n   update your path to include the directory where pandoc's\n   binaries are installed.\n\n - If you prefer not to use the msi installer, we also provide\n   a zip file that contains pandoc's binaries and\n   documentation. Simply unzip this file and move the binaries\n   to a directory of your choice.\n    \n - Alternatively, you can install pandoc using\n   [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org): `choco install pandoc`.\n\n - For PDF output, you'll also need to install LaTeX.\n   [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) is recommended.\n\n\n### macOS\n\n - There is a package installer at pandoc's\n   [download page](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/latest).\n   If you later want to uninstall the package, you can do so by downloading\n   [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgm/pandoc/master/macos/uninstall-pandoc.pl)\n   and running it with `perl uninstall-pandoc.pl`.\n\n - A zip file containing the binaries and man pages, for those who prefer not\n   to use the installer is also provided\n   [here](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/latest). Simply unzip the\n   file and move the binaries and man pages to whatever directory you like.\n\n - Alternative, you can install pandoc using [homebrew](https://brew.sh):\n   `brew install pandoc`. Note: If you are using macOS < 10.10, this method\n   installs pandoc from source, so it will take a long time and a lot of disk\n   space for the ghc compiler and dependent Haskell libraries.\n\n - For PDF output, you'll also need LaTeX. Because a full [MacTeX] installation\n   takes more than a gigabyte of disk space, it is recommended to install\n   [BasicTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html) (64M) or\n   [TinyTeX](https://yihui.name/tinytex/) and using the `tlmgr` tool to install\n   additional packages as needed. If you get errors warning of fonts not found,\n   try `tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended`.\n\n### Linux\n\n - First, try your package manager. Pandoc is in the\n   [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/pandoc),\n   [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/pandoc),\n   [Slackware](https://www.slackbuilds.org/result/?search=pandoc&sv=),\n   [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/pandoc),\n   [Fedora](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/pandoc),\n   [NiXOS](https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html),\n   [openSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/package/pandoc),\n   and [gentoo](packages.gentoo.org/package/app-text/pandoc) repositories.\n   Note, however, that versions in the repositories are often old.\n   Distro specific instructions are below.\n\n - Pandoc also provides a binary package for amd64 architecture on the\n   [download page](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/latest). This\n   provides both `pandoc` and `pandoc-citeproc`. The executables are statically\n   linked and have no dynamic dependencies or dependencies on external data\n   files. Note: because of the static linking, the pandoc library from this\n   package cannot use lua filters that require external lua modules written\n   in C.\n\n - For PDF output, you'll need LaTeX. It is recommended to install\n   [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) via your package manager.\n\n#### Ubuntu\n\n`$ sudo apt install pandoc`\n\nFor PDF output, you'll need LaTeX. [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) is\nrecommended.\n\n`$ sudo apt install texlive`\n\n#### Fedora\n\n`$ sudo dnf install pandoc`\n\nFor PDF output, you'll need LaTeX. [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) is\nrecommended.\n\n`$ sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-medium`\n\n#### Arch\n\n`$ sudo pacman -S pandoc`\n\nFor PDF output, you'll need LaTeX. [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) is\nrecommended.\n\n`$ sudo pacman -S texlive-most`\n\nSee [TeX Live](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TeX_Live) on the Arch wiki\nfor more information on the different TeX Live groups available.\n",
