  "readme": "# atom-gist-dev package\n\nA package to facilitate easy, all-in-one Gist development for non-developers.\n\nThis package creates a new top-level menu item named Gist Dev, and offers three\npieces of functionality within that menu.\n\n## Clone a Gist Repository\n\nOnce you have forked or created a Gist on GitHub, you are able to copy the HTTPS\nclone URL.\n\n![fork_and_copy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CenterForAssessment/atom-gist-dev/master/assets/fork_and_copy.gif)\n\nWith the URL in your clipboard, open the Gist Dev menu and select the **Clone a\nGist Repository** item. You will then be presented with an input field where you\ncan paste the URL copied from GitHub. Click the Clone button or press enter, and\nthe repository will be cloned to your computer.\n\nAtom will then open the directory it created in a new window and you can begin\nediting files.\n\n**Note:** By default, the files will be copied to your `/tmp` directory. You can\nchange the directory that will be used in the settings for this package.\n\n## Save Changes\n\nAny time you want to save your progress, open the Gist Dev menu and select the\n**Save Changes** item. This will commit your changes to the source control system,\nwhich means your project can be restored to its current state at any point in\nthe future.\n\n## Save Changes and Share on GitHub\n\nIf you're happy with your changes and would like to share them with others, use\nthe **Save Changes and Share on GitHub** item under the Gist Dev menu. This will\ncommit your changes just like the Save Changes menu item, but will also send\nyour changes back up to GitHub. Once your changes have been sent, a link to view\nyour page on https://nciea-gist-viewer.herokuapp.com/ will be put in your clipboard.\n\nOpen a browser and paste in the URL to see your creation come to life!\n",
