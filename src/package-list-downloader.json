  "readme": "# package-list-downloader package\n\nPackage helps download predefined and custom list of packages. This is useful in two cases:\n\n* If you don't want to look around for recommended packages for your programming language.\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3289225/5237731/881873d4-789a-11e4-892c-9d6408a5c42f.gif) \n\n* If you want to share your own package list with your friend or with the world :). Right now you can do it using Gist.\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3289225/5237725/be0d3692-7899-11e4-9451-e8c4435f045c.gif) \n\nMore predefined list to come, feel free to post your favourite or your own packages for me to add to predefined lists.\n\nThe package role isn't to replace oficial package manager. Goal is to make those two use cases bit more easier.  \n",
