  "readme": "# Take a break\n\nTHIS ATOM PLUGIN IS CUSTOMIZED FROM [__TAKE A BREAK EVERY 25 MINUTES.__](https://github.com/dtinth/tabe25m). IT WILL FORCE YOU TO TAKE A BREAK FOR A PERIOD THAT YOU SET IN THE CONFIG. IN FACT, IT WORK SAME AS [__TAKE A BREAK EVERY 25 MINUTES.__](https://github.com/dtinth/tabe25m) IN DEFAULT SETTING.\n\n## CUSTOMIZE\n\n![CUSTOMIZE](http://i.imgur.com/uE5dcUs.png)\n\nTHERE ARE 3 THINGS THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE IT BY YOURSELF\n\n1. WORK TIME - HOW LONG DO YOU WANT TO WORK BEFORE YOU TAKE A BREAK?\n\n2. BREAK TIME - HOW LONG DO YOU WANT TO BREAK?\n\n3. WARN TIME - HOW LONG DO YOU WANT THIS PLUGIN NOTIFIES YOU BEFORE IT FORCES YOU TO TAKE A BREAK? \n\n=====\n\n# TABE25M\n\nTHIS ATOM PLUGIN WILL FORCE YOU TO __TAKE A BREAK EVERY 25 MINUTES.__ EACH BREAK LASTS 5 MINUTES. INSPIRED BY THE POMODORO TECHNIQUE.\nI CREATED THIS PLUGIN BECAUSE I FOUND MYSELF CODING NONSTOP FOR HOURS.\nTHIS IS NOT A HEALTHY HABIT AND IT HURTS MY EYES, JUST LIKE A WALL OF ALL CAPITALIZED TEXT YOU ARE READING HERE.\n\n## USAGE\n\n### TYPING IN ATOM WILL SET A 25 MINUTES TIMER\n\n### AS THE BREAK TIME APPROACHES, A REMINDER WILL APPEAR.\n\n![REMINDER](http://i.imgur.com/xT0oj1m.png)\n\n### THE REMINDER INTENSIFIES AS THE BREAK APPROACHES\n\n![IT’S COMING!!](http://i.imgur.com/83Ovow8.png)\n\n### THEN IT COMPLETELY FILLS YOUR SCREEN, FORCING YOU TO TAKE A BREAK\n\n![IT’S BREAK TIME!!!](http://i.imgur.com/swpzNWh.png)\n\n### ALL ATOM WINDOWS ARE LOCKED AT THE SAME TIME, SO YOU CANNOT SWITCH TO ANOTHER WINDOW DURING THE BREAK.\n\n![LOCKED.](http://i.imgur.com/BMVx3Gk.png)\n\n## CUSTOMIZE BY\n\n[@ReiiYuki](https://github.com/ReiiYuki)\n\n## ORIGINAL BY\n\n[@dtinth](https://github.com/dtinth)\n",
