  "readme": "# Atom WebStorm Integration\n\n_NOTE: Just a placeholder for now. Very early stage. Not ready for use._\n\n> Allow using WebStorm features such as the indexer from Atom.\n\n## Why?\n\nWebStorm has a great indexer for JavaScript which allows easy `cmd-click` code navigation and refactoring. It also has a superior JavaScript formatter and debugger.\n\nAtom has a [few solutions to these problems](#native-atom-plugins) as plugins but I could not find them to work as well as WebStorm.\n\nThis module would bring the reliable indexing and refactoring into Atom with minimal effort, reducing any barriers to switchers.\n\n## How?\n\nThere will be a plugin for WebStorm/IntelliJ which will provide a JS interface to the Java API, via a websockets server running in the Atom plugin (or the other way around I'm not sure what's easiest).\n\n## Status\n\n2016-04: The plumbing of communicating with websockets to an IntelliJ plugin is mostly done.\n\n## Planned\n\n- [ ] `cmd-click` code navigation using the WS index.\n- [ ] Rename refactoring/find usages using the WS index.\n- [ ] Autocomplete using the WS index.\n- [ ] WebStorm code formatter.\n- [ ] Open file in Atom.\n- [ ] Open file in WebStorm.\n- [ ] WebStorm diff integration.\n\n## Future\n\nI only use JavaScript, but obviously this could be modified to work with other JetBrains IDE supported languages.\n\n## Caveat\n\n## Usage\n\n- TODO: Install the Atom plugin for Webstorm or IntelliJ IDEA.\n- `apm install atom-webstorm`\n-\n\n## Native Atom Plugins\n\nThese are plugins that are the closest thing I could find to get similar WebStorm functionality for Atom.\n\n##### Refactoring\n\n- refactor + js-refactor\n\n##### Code navigation\n\n- atom-ternjs\n- atom-ctags\n- hyperclick + js-hyperclick\n\n##### Autocomplete\n\n- autocomplete-modules\n",
