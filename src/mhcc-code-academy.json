Doing it this way because the computers get scrubbed every day and installing the packages over and over again one at a time is a pain. \n\nDown the road this approach could lend itself to distributing tutorials directly to the students' editors and other niceties.\n\nPackages we're installing:\n\n- [color-picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker)\n- [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)\n- [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet)\n- [local-server-express](https://atom.io/packages/local-server-express)\n\n",
