  "readme": "## Credit where credit is due\n\nSee [probers1/language-hl7](https://github.com/probers1/language-hl7)\n\n## packages package\n\nHL7 Support for Atom.  Adapted from Sublime Text package.\n\n## But I helped too!\n\nMuch of this already existed however it wasn't in the Atom registry and me and\nmy team wanted some additional pieces such as easy to spot missing line breaks\nafter a PID segment, an easy to spot Patient Identifier, etc.\n\nIt also wasn't in the Atom Registry so one would have to clone to desktop and\nmove it over to ~/.atom/packages\n\nIf there is something missing that YOU want to see feel free to let me know\nI'll work on it when I can - you're also free to add it yourself!\n",
