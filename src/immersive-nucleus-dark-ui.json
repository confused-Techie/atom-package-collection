  "readme": "# Immersive-Nucleus Dark UI\n\nNucleus is an adaptable UI theme for Atom with your favorite syntax coloring at its core! This gives the UI a coherent feel, with whatever syntax theme you like to use.\n\n## Statement\n\nThis is a fork of Nuclues Dark UI, I just change some variables of the style and make it immersive just like the design of Material UI\n\n![Material Syntax](http://i.imgur.com/CjuZVag.jpg)\n\n## Installation\n\nInside atom go to settings, select Install and search for Nucleus.\n\nOr install directly from the console:\n\n`apm install immersive-nucleus-dark-ui`\n\n## Requirements\n\nEvery color used in the UI is taken directly from a (dark) syntax theme. In order for this to work, the syntax theme needs to have a `syntax-variables.less`. A light version of this theme is still being worked on.\n\n## Support\n\n[Buy me a coffee to keep me going](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YW2GB7ABTVCVA)\n\n## Features\n\n- Clutterless new windows with a flat background. ![Atom Dark Fusion](http://i.imgur.com/UOAuMpg.png)\n\n- A minimal approach by using only three colors in the background of the theme. All colors used are mixed variations on colors from the syntax theme. ![Gruvbox Plus](http://i.imgur.com/SkwaV9x.png)\n\n- Floating modal overlays (Command Palette, Fuzzy Finder etc) with a nice big type, strongly inspired by Spotlight on OS X. ![Gruvbox Plus](http://i.imgur.com/inUen2W.png)\n\n- Consistent design over different packages. File an issue if you think a package you're using needs some tweaking. ![Firewatch](http://i.imgur.com/O3cdoGH.png)\n\n### Themes used in screenshots\n\nThe syntax themes in the screenshots are some of my personal favorites:\n\n- [Atom Fusion Dark](https://atom.io/themes/atom-dark-fusion-syntax)\n- [Gruvbox Plus](https://atom.io/themes/gruvbox-plus-syntax)\n- [Firewatch](https://atom.io/themes/firewatch-syntax)\n",
