  "readme": "# active-tab-in-front package\n\n[![apm install active-tab-in-front](https://apm-badges.herokuapp.com/apm/active-tab-in-front.svg)](https://atom.io/packages/active-tab-in-front)\n\nThis package provides means for a very intuitive workflow in regards to tab\n(items) management. It's comprised of two concepts: treating the collection of\nall pane items as a wheel, and being able to easily navigate between a few items\nunder your immediate attention.\n\n### Typical workflow\n\nThis workflow is comprised entirely using 4 commands:\n\n1. `alt-<N>` switch to N-th most recently active item\n2. `ctrl-p` (or other) rotate item \"wheel\" to the left\n3. `ctrl-n` (or other) rotate item \"wheel\" to the right\n4. `ctrl-b` (`fuzzy-finder:toggle-buffer-finder`) bring up a deep item\n\nMost often I use `alt-2` through `alt-4` to navigate between a few files I'm\nattending to.\n\nRemaining commands are used to find something farther down. `ctrl-b` allows you\nto find item by its name but I actually find myself using `ctrl-p` and\n`ctrl-n` more often.\n\nI also use `ctrl-n` to \"forget\" about the item, and `ctrl-p` to bring it\nback. The wheel metaphor is mostly there for intuition, as it is hard to\ndescribe item destination otherwise.\n\n### Keymap\n\nI use following snippet to enable the key bindings as described above. You can\nadd this to `keymap.cson` (Edit > Keymap). Note: this will override default\ncommands: `fuzzy-finder:toggle-file-finder` and `application:new-file`.\n\n```\n'atom-workspace':\n  'ctrl-p': 'pane:show-previous-item'\n  'ctrl-n': 'active-tab-in-front:bury-active-item'\n```\n",
