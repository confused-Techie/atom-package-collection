  "readme": "# Lipsum\n\nUse this package if you want to add dummy Lorem Ipsum text to your page.\n\nYou can add a sentence, paragraph, or series of paragraphs to the page.  For\nHTML pages you can wrap the paragraphs in HTML `<p>` tags.\n\nFor anyone familiar with the existing\n[Lorem Ipsum package](https://github.com/nickclaw/atom-lorem-ipsum) you will\nnotice a lot of similarities.  Unfortunately that one doesn't work with\nAtom >= 1.0, and that's why this now exists.  I had already completed a lot of\nthe work before I realised that existed which is why it's not a straight fork\nof that package.\n\n## Install\n\nYou can install it from the package manager.  Just search for \"lipsum\".\n\nOr you can install it using APM.\n\n```\napm install lipsum\n```\n\n## How to use\n\nTo use this, load the command panel, type \"Lipsum\" and choose the relevant\noption.  Alternatively you can right click and choose \"Lipsum\", or choose\n\"Lipsum\" from the Packages menu.\n\n## Config options\n\nThere are a number of configuration options:\n\n### Sentences/Paragraphs\n\n#### Number of paragraphs\nThe number of paragraphs to generate when running the 'paragraphs' command\".\n\nThe default value is 4.\n\n#### Maximum words per sentence\nWhen generating content, any sentence created will have no more than this\nnumber of words.  \n\nThe default is 18.\n\n#### Minimum words per sentence\nWhen generating content, any sentence created will have at least this number of\nwords.  \n\nThe default is 8.\n\n#### Maximum sentences per paragraph\nWhen generating content, any paragraph created will have no more than this\nnumber of sentences.  \n\nThe default is 8.\n\n#### Minimum sentences per paragraph\nWhen generating content, any paragraph created will have at least than this\nnumber of sentences.  \n\nThe default is 3.\n\n### HTML Extensions\nYou can also specify a list of file extensions where any paragraphs generated\nwill be wrapped in HTML `<p> </p>` tags.  This option is a list of file\nextensions for HTML file types.\n\nThe default values are:\n- .html\n- .htm (does anyone still use this?)\n- .php (I'm not sure whether this should be included here or not, but you can\noverride it if you want to)\n- .twig (Twig templates)\n- .tpl (Smarty templates)\n\nWhen adding others, these should be added in lowercase, and remember to include\nthe opening '.'\n",
